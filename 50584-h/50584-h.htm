<h2><br /><span class="small">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>This publication has been prepared to assist forest managers and homeowners
in identifying pests of southern trees. The insects and diseases
discussed are the more common ones attacking forest and ornamental
trees. Prompt identification and treatment of these pests may mean the
difference between losing or saving a valuable shade tree. Underlying all
successful forest and ornamental pest control efforts, however, is the
necessity to keep trees in a healthy, vigorous condition.</p>
<p>We have attempted to include pictures of the damage as well as pictures
of the damage-causing organism or stage. Chemical suppression recommendations
are not included in this publication. For pesticide information
contact the local State or Federal extension specialist, forester,
entomologist, or pathologist.</p>
<p>Credit for some of the pictures in this guide goes to the Southern and
Southeastern Forest Experiment Stations and universities. We acknowledge
the help of the Forest Pest Management field personnel who
assisted in compiling this booklet.</p>

<h3 id="c1">ELM SPANWORM, <i>Ennomos subsignarius</i> (Hbn.)</h3>
<p>The elm spanworm is a native insect
which is widely distributed over the
eastern half of the United States
and Canada from Nova Scotia south
to Georgia and west to Colorado.
The most widespread outbreak on
record occurred during the period
1954-1963 when over one million
acres of hardwood forests were
defoliated in the mountains of
western North Carolina, eastern
Tennessee and northern Georgia.
The elm spanworm feeds upon
hickories and a variety of hardwoods;
white oak, chestnut oak, and northern red oak are the species most
heavily defoliated in the Appalachians. Repeated defoliation causes
growth loss, reduces mast crops, and will eventually kill the tree.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig1">
<img src="images/i002.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="470" />
<p class="pcap">Sixth instar elm spanworm larva.</p>
</div>
<p>Eggs are laid in masses of 12 to 200 on the undersides of host tree
branches in early July. Winter is spent in the egg stage. Larvae hatch in
early spring when foliage opens. The larval stage is an &ldquo;inchworm&rdquo; or
&ldquo;looper&rdquo;, approximately 1&frac12; inches long when mature. Larval
coloring varies from green or light brown to black, depending upon
population density. The typical color of the larva in heavy populations
is dark brown to black, with a dark-red head, legs, and anal shield. The
larvae feed for about 1&frac12; months, and then pupate in a loose cocoon
for six to ten days. The adult, a
snow-white moth, emerges in late
June or early July. There is one
generation per year.</p>
<p>Natural enemies help keep populations
of the elm spanworm in
check. One of the most important
is <i>Telenomus alsophilae</i>, a
tiny wasp which parasitizes eggs.
Persistent outbreaks on high-value
stands may require treatment
with chemicals.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<h3 id="c2">FALL CANKERWORM, <i>Alsophila pometaria</i> (Harris)</h3>
<p>The fall cankerworm is widespread
in the northern part of the United
States, ranging south through the
Appalachian Mountains to North
Carolina. Larvae defoliate many
species of hardwoods, but in the
South seem to prefer oaks, hickories,
and ash.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/i003.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="497" />
<p class="pcap">Mature fall cankerworm larva.</p>
</div>
<p>The winged male and wingless female
adults emerge on mild days in
November and December and mate.
Females lay 6-300 eggs in neatly
arranged masses encircling small
branches and twigs. The pale green larvae hatch in late April or early
May. As they mature they may remain light green, or change to a very
dark brownish-green depending on the host. Newly hatched inch-worms
(larvae) of the fall cankerworm chew small holes in expanding leaves of
their hosts, or may completely skeletonize the leaves. Mature larvae
consume all but the mid-rib and major veins of the leaf. Feeding is
usually completed in four to five weeks, at which time larvae drop to
the ground to pupate in the soil.</p>
<p>Cold, wet weather during the early larval period, and parasitization, are
responsible for sudden declines in established populations. Chemical
control has also been effective. A small wasp, <i>Telenomus alsophilae</i>
Viereck, has caused a sharp decline
in outbreaks of cankerworm
populations. Usually, however,
outbreak conditions must
exist for several years before the
parasite can attain the density
needed to cause a decline.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<h3 id="c3">A LOOPER, <i>Phigalia titea</i> (Cramer)</h3>
<p>Larvae of this moth, one of the
measuring worms, have periodically
been responsible for scattered mortality
of hardwoods throughout the
eastern United States. Mortality is
most likely to occur in stands on
low-quality sites, particularly during
periods of drought which favor
this insect&rsquo;s development and further
weaken infested trees. This
species is likely to be found in
almost any hardwood area in the
eastern United States. The insect
feeds on a wide variety of trees and
shrubs. Host trees in the Southeast
include oaks, hickories, black tupelo,
and black locust.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/i003b.jpg" alt="" width="596" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Phigalia adult male moth.</p>
</div>
<p><i>Phigalia titea</i> overwinters as a pupa. Adults emerge in late March to
mid-April, and mate. The female lays her eggs in protected sites on
branches and trunks of hardwoods. Eggs are most often laid in crevices
and beneath the bark of dead branches. Eggs hatch in April, and larvae
feed until early June. Larvae often feed on unopened buds, causing
irregular holes in the developing leaves. Larvae first eat just the surfaces
of leaves, but later consume all leaf tissue between the major veins.
When larvae are dislodged by wind
or feeding predators they fall or
descend on a silken thread and
continue feeding in the lower
crown or on understory vegetation.
Pupation occurs on the soil surface
or in the litter.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/i003c.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="369" />
<p class="pcap">Phigalia larva.</p>

<p>Weather regulates populations of
this insect. Soil-inhabiting insects
and rodents are believed to destroy
many pupae during the winter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<h3 id="c4">EASTERN TENT CATERPILLAR, <i>Malacosoma americanum</i> (F.)</h3>
<p>The presence of the eastern tent
caterpillar is objectionable more
from an aesthetic standpoint than
from its effect on the host tree. The
ugly tents constructed by the feeding
larvae make this pest highly
objectionable on shade trees. Black
cherry and other species of the
genus <i>Prunus</i> are preferred hosts,
but other trees in the family
<i>Rosaceae</i> are sometimes attacked.
This insect is widely distributed
wherever host trees are found east
of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/i004.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="499" />
<p class="pcap">Larvae and tent of eastern tent caterpillar.</p>
</div>
<p>The caterpillars appear at about the same time the leaves of black
cherry begin to unfold. The larvae construct a web or tent in the crotch
of a small branch, and begin feeding. Usually they consume entire
leaves, except for the large veins. As the larvae mature, they add to the
tent, which may reach a foot in diameter and two feet in length.
Reaching maturity in about six weeks, the larvae drop to the ground
and pupate. The moths emerge in June and the females lay eggs. Eggs of
the eastern tent caterpillar are shiny black masses which encircle the
smaller twigs and are quite noticeable. The insect overwinters in the egg
stage.</p>
<p>Control on ornamental, fruit, and
shade trees is achieved by pruning off
and burning the tents containing the
caterpillars.</p>

<h3 id="c5">FOREST TENT CATERPILLAR, <i>Malacosoma disstria</i> (Hbn.)</h3>
<p>The forest tent caterpillar has
caused repeated serious defoliation
of hardwood forests
throughout North America. Aspen,
water tupelo, hard maple,
gums, and oaks are preferred
hosts but this insect will feed on
a variety of other broadleaf trees.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/i004b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="382" />
<p class="pcap">Forest tent caterpillar larvae.</p>
</div>
<p>The shiny black egg masses encircling
the twigs of host trees can
be seen during winter months.
Small black, hairy larvae hatch out just as the leaves are beginning to
unfold. They do not construct a tent, but make a silken mat on the
larger branches or trunk of the tree on which they rest between feeding
periods. When full grown, the larvae are about two inches long,
brownish-black with distinctive white, keyhole-shaped spots down the
middle of the back, and blue lines along the sides. Just before pupating,
the larvae spin a whitish silk
cocoon on the bark or leaf of the
host. In about ten days the light
brown moths emerge, mate, and
the females begin laying their
eggs.</p>
<p>Parasitic flies are one of the more
important agents which normally
keep this insect under control.
Outbreaks occur with some regularity,
however, and chemicals
may be required to prevent defoliation.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<h3 id="c6">FALL WEBWORM, <i>Hyphantria cunea</i> (Drury)</h3>
<p>The fall webworm is not considered
an important forest pest.
However, ugly webs can seriously
detract from aesthetic values.
The preferred hosts in the South
are persimmon, pecan, and sourwood,
but it is also found on
black walnut, hickory, cherry,
sycamore, crab apple, and sweetgum.
The insects range throughout
North America.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/i005.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="476" />
<p class="pcap">Fall webworm larva.</p>
</div>
<p>The adult is a pure white moth
about 1&frac14; inches long. The
forewing is sometimes marked
with blackish dots. The larva is about one inch long when full grown,
generally pale yellow or greenish with a broad dark longitudinal stripe
on the back and a yellowish stripe extending from black and orange
warts. The insect has one generation per year in the northern part of its
range, and two in the southern part. Moths of the first generation
emerge from May to July and those of the second in July and August.
Adult females lay 400-500 eggs in white cottony patches on the
underside of the leaves of host plants. The eggs hatch in about a week,
and the larvae form a web and begin to skeletonize the leaves by
feeding in rows. As the larvae grow
they expand the web to cover the
colony. When the larvae are ready
to pupate, they crawl or drop to
the ground and form a brownish
cocoon in the duff around the tree
where they overwinter.</p>

<p>Natural enemies usually keep this
insect under control. Webs can be
pruned from high-value trees in
scenic or recreation areas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h3 id="c7">OAK LEAF TIER, <i>Croesia albicomana</i> (Clem.)</h3>
<p>This oak leaf tier has been
associated with the decline
and mortality of several
species of oak in the northeastern
United States and
southern Appalachians. An
outbreak population in the
mountains of West Virginia
and Virginia in 1966-68 resulted
in the loss of several
thousand acres of scarlet oak.
Usually such outbreaks coincide
with periods of drought
which increase the impact of
defoliation on the host. Its hosts include northern red oak, black oak,
scarlet oak, and pin oak. The latter two species seem to be hit hardest
by this insect.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/i005c.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="414" />
<p class="pcap">Leaf tier adult and pupa.</p>
</div>
<p><i>Croesia albicomana</i> spends the winter in the egg stage. Eggs are
glued to small twigs in the crown of the host tree. Hatch occurs from
mid-April to early May. Young larvae, which emerge before bud-break,
bore into and mine the expanding buds. When large numbers of this
insect are present they can destroy most of the vegetative buds on a
tree. Later the older larvae tie down a folded-over portion of a leaf and
feed on it. Leaves fed on by the oak leaf tier appear to be full of shot
holes. As the larvae near maturity they may tie the apical portion of
two or more leaves together and feed on them. Mature larvae then drop
to the ground to pupate in the
litter. Adult moths emerge in
June or early July, mate, and the
female immediately begins laying
eggs. The small, flat, oval eggs are
deposited individually on small
twigs, generally around nodes or
leaf scars.</p>

<p>Little is known of the natural
factors which regulate population
levels of this insect, but undoubtedly
weather is important.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<h3 id="c8">VARIABLE OAK LEAF CATERPILLAR, <i>Heterocampa maneto</i> (Dbldy.)</h3>
<p>The variable oak leaf caterpillar periodically
defoliates extensive areas of
hardwood forest in the eastern United
States. Its range covers all of the
southern and eastern states as far west
as east Texas. The larvae feed primarily
on oaks but will also feed on
beech, basswood, birch and elm.
Other defoliating insects may be associated
with outbreaks causing additional
damage. Young larvae skeletonize
the leaf while older larvae
devour the entire leaf except the
primary veins. Infestations are generally
more severe in the South, where
the insect has two generations per
year causing two periods of defoliation
in a single year. While infestations
usually subside before many trees are
killed, heavy defoliation reduces the
tree&rsquo;s growth and vigor.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/i006.jpg" alt="" width="571" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Larva of the variable oak leaf caterpillar.</p>
</div>
<p>The variable oak leaf caterpillar overwinters as a non-feeding larva in a
cocoon on the forest floor. It pupates and emerges as a moth the
following spring. The female moth, gray in color and about 1&frac34; inches
long, lays about 500 eggs singly on the leaves of host trees. The larvae
feed on foliage for five or six weeks, drop to the ground to pupate, and
emerge as adults in mid-summer. Larvae hatching from eggs laid by the
second generation of moths defoliate the trees for a second time during
late summer. By late October the mature larvae of the second
generation have dropped to the forest floor to overwinter. The full
grown larva is approximately 1&frac12; inches long. Color varies among
individuals. The head is generally amber brown with curved diagonal
white and black bands. The body is usually yellow green with a narrow
white stripe down the center of the back bordered by wider dark bands.</p>
<p>Outbreaks of the variable oak leaf caterpillar may be severe but
generally subside before serious tree mortality occurs. Parasites and
predators are not effective in controlling rising populations of the
insect. Mice and predaceous beetles feed on the resting larvae and pupae
in the litter and soil of the forest floor. While no chemical is currently
registered for control of this insect, chemical spraying has been
effective and safe in controlling closely related insects.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h3 id="c9">LOCUST LEAFMINER, <i>Xenochalepus dorsalis</i> (Thunberg)</h3>
<p>The locust leafminer is a destructive
pest of black locust and honey
locust in both the adult and larval
stages. It is found throughout the
range of these trees in the eastern
half of North America. The adults
also feed on other species of trees.</p>
<p>The adult beetles overwinter in
crevices in the bark of trees and
under litter on the forest floor. The
beetles emerge and begin feeding in
the spring, usually after mid-April.
After feeding for a short time they
deposit eggs on the undersides of
leaves, piling them one upon
another, somewhat shingle-like. Eggs are covered with brownish fecal
matter. Larvae soon hatch and eat into the leaf tissue to form a mine.
Newly emerged larvae feed gregariously in a single mine for a short
time. They then construct new mines where the insects live singly.
Several mines are constructed before the larvae reach maturity. The
larvae pupate in the mines and emerge as adults in July to begin the
second generation. The adult beetles are foliage feeders, eating irregular
holes in leaves. When sufficient in number they may defoliate host
trees.</p>

<p class="pcap">Damage to black locust caused by the locust leaf miner.</p>

aesthetic viewpoint.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h3 id="c10">COTTONWOOD LEAF BEETLE, <i>Chrysomela scripta</i> (F.)</h3>
<p>Willows, poplars, aspens and alders
are attacked by the cottonwood
leaf beetle in the eastern United
States. Cottonwood is the most important
host in the South. Damage
has been especially severe in Louisiana
and Mississippi where thousands
of acres of cottonwood
plantations are intensively managed.
Adult beetles and larvae feed
on the foliage. Damage is most critical
during the first three years after
the cottonwood is planted. Adults
chew holes in the leaves and may
attack the terminal shoots causing
reduced growth or stem deformity.
Young larvae skeletonize the foliage
but older larvae consume all foliage
except the leaf midribs. Damage may become severe enough to cause
mortality.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/i007.jpg" alt="" width="587" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Cottonwood leaf beetle adult.</p>
</div>
<p>The cottonwood leaf beetle overwinters in the adult stage. Eggs are laid
in the spring. The female lays a cluster of about 75 yellowish eggs on
the underside of a leaf. As the larvae mature they become yellow with
black spots. After about nine days in the larval stage the beetle transforms
into the non-feeding pupal stage which lasts five to ten days. The
adult is about &frac14;-inch long and has a black head and thorax. The wing
covers are yellow with longitudinal
black stripes. The life cycle is completed
in 25 to 30 days and several
generations occur in a single year.</p>

registered for cottonwood leaf
beetle control.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h3 id="c11">WALKINGSTICK, <i>Diapheromera femorata</i> (Say)</h3>
<p>The walkingstick is a defoliator
of broadleaved trees in North
America. The black oaks, basswood,
and wild cherry are the
most common preferred hosts
but numerous other hardwood
species are attacked. This insect
is widely distributed over the
United States east of the Rocky
Mountains as well as Manitoba
and Ontario in Canada. At times,
populations build in sufficient
numbers to defoliate trees over
large areas.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">
<img src="images/i007b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="427" />
<p class="pcap">Male walkingsticks feeding on oak.</p>
</div>
<p>These slender, wingless, stick-like insects are pale green when young,
but gradually change to a dark green, gray, or brown at maturity. The
adult female measures up to three inches in length and is more stout-bodied
than the male. Mating usually takes place in August and egg
laying begins six to ten days later. The eggs are dropped to the ground
where they overwinter in the leaf litter. In the northern part of the
walkingstick&rsquo;s range the eggs take two years to hatch. In the South,
walkingstick eggs hatch the summer after they are laid, usually starting
in mid-May. The newly hatched walkingstick looks like a miniature
adult.</p>
<p>Parasitic wasps and flies are active against the immature walkingsticks
but are not efficient enough to cause a substantial population reduction.
Flocks of robins, blackbirds, and grackles have a much greater
impact, however. The defoliation caused by walkingsticks generally
occurs on upland sites in stands which are not of high value or intensively
managed. For this reason there has been little interest in control.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h3 id="c12">GYPSY MOTH, <i>Porthetria dispar</i> (L.)</h3>
<p>The gypsy moth is an introduced
forest insect. It was brought into
this country from Europe in
1869 and has been restricted to
the Northeast. The gypsy moth
feeds aggressively on oak, alder,
apple, basswood, willow, and
birch. As the caterpillars reach
maturity they will also feed on
hemlock, cedar, pine, and spruce.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/i008.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="534" />
<p class="pcap">Gypsy moth larvae.</p>
</div>
<p>In the Northeast, the gypsy moth
has a single generation per year,
overwintering in the egg stage.
Eggs hatch in late April and May
and larvae are present for
approximately two months. Full-grown caterpillars measure more than
two inches long and are easily identified by the five pairs of blue spots
and six pairs of red spots arranged in a double row along the back. The
adult moths are active from late June to early September. Female
moths, their bodies heavy with eggs, are unable to fly and must rely on
a powerful sex attractant to lure male moths. This sex attractant has
been chemically synthesized and is used as a trap bait in surveys designed
to determine the presence of gypsy moths in areas suspected to be
infested. Each female deposits from 200 to 800 eggs in a buff-colored
mass which she attaches to any convenient surface including cars, trailers,
and other vehicles.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig21">
<img src="images/i008a.jpg" alt="" width="544" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Female gypsy moths depositing egg masses.</p>
</div>
<p>During the past 75 years the gypsy
moth has been the target of many
large-scale control programs, and much
money has been spent trying to reduce
the impact of gypsy moth infestations.
Current control efforts are
handicapped by the unavailability of a
safe and effective persistent chemical.
In the North two predators and nine
parasites have been successfully established
to help control the gypsy moth.
The greatest problem in controlling
gypsy moth spread, however, lies in
the fact that recreational vehicles
transport egg masses and larvae from
infested sites into uninfested areas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h3 id="c13">HICKORY BARK BEETLE, <i>Scolytus quadrispinosus</i> (Say)</h3>
<p>The hickory bark beetle is reported
to be the most serious insect pest of
hickory in the United States. Population
explosions where thousands
of trees were killed have been reported
from New York, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Virginia, and
recently from Georgia. Hickory
bark beetles are distributed
throughout the range of their host
in eastern United States. All species
of hickory are subject to attack, as
well as pecan and possibly butternut.
Adult beetles emerge in May
and June in the southern portion of
their range. They feed for a short time by boring into the petioles of
leaves and into small twigs of the host. Dying leaves and twigs are the
first evidence of attack. After feeding, the beetles fly to the trunk and
larger branches of the host and bore into the inner bark to lay their
eggs. Short, longitudinal egg galleries are etched into the sapwood and
from 20 to 60 eggs deposited in small niches cut on either side of the
gallery. As the larvae develop, their galleries radiate out from the egg

Mississippi. The beetle overwinters in the larval stage. With the coming
of warm weather in the early spring, it changes into the pupal stage, and
finally, in May, to an adult.</p>

<h3 id="c14">SMALLER EUROPEAN ELM BARK BEETLE, <i>Scolytus multistriatus</i> (Marsham)</h3>
<p>The smaller European elm bark
beetle was first reported in the
United States in 1909. Its presence
in this country was given significance
with the introduction of the
Dutch elm disease in 1930. The
beetle attacks all native and introduced
species of elms and now
occurs wherever the hosts are
present. The feeding of the adult
beetles in the spring is responsible
for transmitting the Dutch elm disease
from diseased to healthy trees.
The Dutch elm disease is now our
most important shade tree disease.</p>

<img src="images/i009.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="443" />
<p class="pcap">Smaller European elm bark beetle adult.</p>
</div>
<p>Adult bark beetles emerge in the spring from dead or dying elms and
begin feeding on the twigs of healthy elms. The female then excavates
an egg gallery in the bark of dead or weakened elms. Eggs are deposited
along the walls of the gallery. The larvae, upon hatching, burrow into
the bark at right angles to the egg gallery. Pupation occurs at the end of
the larval tunnel. New adults tunnel to the bark surface and leave the
tree through circular emergence holes. There are usually two generations
a year. The beetles overwinter in the larval stage.</p>
<p>Chemical control and good tree maintenance are the two methods used
to reduce bark beetle populations. Insecticides are used to prevent
feeding by the adults in the spring. Tree sanitation involves removal and
disposal of dead elms and elm limbs which eliminate breeding and
larval development sites.</p>

<h3 id="c15">COLUMBIAN TIMBER BEETLE, <i>Corthylus columbianus</i> (Hopkins)</h3>
<p>All hardwood trees in the eastern
half of the United States are subject
to attack by the Columbian
timber beetle, but oaks, maples,
birch, basswood, yellow-poplar,
and elm are the preferred hosts
in the South. The beetle causes
two major types of damage:
1) physical damage caused by the
1/32&Prime; to 1/16&Prime; hole excavated
by the adult into the sapwood,
and 2) degrade caused by stain
which may extend for a considerable
distance above and below
the gallery. Large diameter trees are preferred as hosts, but trees as
small as one and one-fourth inches in diameter may be attacked.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig25">
<img src="images/i009a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="398" />
<p class="pcap">Callow adult and pupae of the Columbian timber beetle.</p>
</div>
<p>There are two and sometimes three generations of this insect each year.
Adults from the first generation emerge from late May through June
and those from the second in October. The first evidence of attack is
the white dust which collects at the entrance hole. Later, depending on
the tree&rsquo;s physiological condition, a sap-soaked area may develop
around the entrance hole. The adult bores a horizontal hole into the
sapwood of a healthy tree for a few inches and later constructs two or
three shorter lateral branches. &ldquo;Cradles&rdquo; (or egg chambers) are then
constructed for a short distance perpendicular to these galleries. The
female deposits a single egg in each
chamber. The offspring spend their
entire developmental period within
the cradles feeding on fungi which
grow on the sapwood. It is this fungus
which causes the extensive
staining characteristic of Columbian
timber beetle attack. Winter is
spent in both the pupal and adult
stages in the brood galleries.</p>

<h3 id="c16">COTTONWOOD TWIG BORER, <i>Gypsonoma haimbachiana</i> (Kearfott)</h3>
<p>The cottonwood twig borer is widely distributed throughout the entire
range of eastern cottonwood, from Canada to the Gulf States and west
to Missouri. The larvae of the cottonwood twig borer feed in the terminals
of the host. This feeding results in reduction of terminal growth
and forked and crooked trunks. Damage is especially severe on young
trees.</p>

<p class="pcap">Three-year-old cottonwood stunted by twig borers.</p>
</div>
<p>The female moth lays eggs on the upper surface of leaves along the
mid-rib, singly or in groups of two to eight. Hatching occurs in about
five days and the young larvae cover themselves with silk mixed with
trash, and then tunnel into the mid-rib. After the first molt, larvae leave
the tunnels and bore into tender shoots. Larvae reach maturity in about
21-23 days and begin moving down the trunk of the tree where they
spin cocoons in sheltered bark crevices, in litter, or between leaf folds.
The adult moths emerge in eight or nine days. It takes from 40-45 days
to complete the life cycle in mid-summer.</p>
<p>The most effective natural control is a potter wasp, <i>Eumenes</i> sp. which
tears open tender cottonwood shoots and removes twig borer larvae
from their galleries. Other wasps parasitizing the twig borer include
<i>Bracon mellitor</i> (Say), <i>Apanteles clavatus</i> (Provancher) and <i>Agathis</i> sp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h3 id="c17">COTTONWOOD BORER, <i>Plectrodera scalator</i> (F.)</h3>
<p>The cottonwood borer is limited
in range to the southern half of
the United States. Hosts include
cottonwood, poplars and willows.
The adults feed on the tender
shoots of young trees causing
them to shrivel and break off.
The larval stage of this insect
tunnels in the inner bark and
wood at the base of the tree and
may kill or severely weaken it.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig29">
<img src="images/i010c.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="521" />
<p class="pcap">Adult cottonwood borer.</p>
</div>
<p>The adult beetles appear in midsummer.
After feeding briefly on
the tender bark of the terminals
the adults descend to the bases of host trees where the female deposits
her eggs in small pits gnawed in the bark. Eggs hatch in about three
weeks. The larvae bore downward in the inner bark, entering a large
root by fall. Larval feeding continues into the second year as the larvae
bore into the inner bark and wood. The larvae transform into the
non-feeding pupal stage and finally into an adult in the summer of the
second year thus completing a two year life cycle. Adult beetles are
1&frac14; to 1&frac12; inches long. They are black with lines of cream-colored
scales forming irregular black patches.</p>
<p>The best control for the cottonwood borer is to maintain a vigorous,
healthy stand. Slow growing, off-site plantings of host trees are the
most severely damaged. While some systemic insecticides have shown
promise, there is currently no registered chemical control method.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h3 id="c18">WHITE OAK BORER, <i>Goes tigrinus</i> (De Geer)</h3>
<p>A recent survey of damage
caused by various wood borers to
three species in the white oak
group revealed an estimated annual
loss in the South exceeding
20 million dollars. One of the
more important borers responsible
for this damage is the white
oak borer.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig30">
<img src="images/i011.jpg" alt="" width="591" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Adult white oak borer.</p>
</div>
<p>Usually the white oak borer attacks
oaks one to eight inches in
diameter. The damage, like that
of other hardwood borers, is the
result of larval feeding in the
wood. Galleries up to one-half
inch in diameter extend upward
through the sapwood into the
heartwood. The white oak borer takes three to four years to complete
one generation. The mated adult female beetle lays her eggs singly in
the inner bark through a small oval niche chewed through the outer
bark. After about three weeks the eggs hatch and the larvae immediately
bore into the sapwood. Later they bore upward into the heartwood.
The boring frass ejected out of the entrance is evidence of an active
infestation. Pupation occurs behind a plug of excelsior-like frass at the
upper end of the gallery in the heartwood. In about three weeks, adults
emerge by boring separate and perfectly round holes through the wood
and bark. In the South, adults generally emerge in May and June and
feed for a short time on oak
leaves and the tender bark of
twigs before the females lay their
eggs.</p>
<p>Woodpeckers may destroy up to
25 percent of the larvae during
the winter months, but this and
the small toll taken by insect
predators and parasites are not
sufficient to keep the white oak
borer population low enough to
avoid serious economic loss.</p>

<h3 id="c19">RED OAK BORER, <i>Enaphalodes rufulus</i> (Hald.)</h3>
<p>The red oak borer is a serious
pest of trees in the red oak
group. It ranges throughout
eastern North America wherever
host species grow. It is estimated
that defects caused by larval tunnels
in the sapwood and heartwood
of host trees costs the
hardwood timber industry millions
of dollars each year.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig32">
<img src="images/i011b.jpg" alt="" width="534" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Adult red oak borer.</p>
</div>
<p>Eggs of the red oak borer are laid
during early and mid-summer in
bark crevices or under patches of
lichen on host trees. After
hatching, larvae bore into the
inner bark region where they
feed until mid-summer of the
next year. This feeding in the
inner bark causes characteristic catfaces or bark pockets. Once larvae
enter the wood they bore upward through the sapwood and into the
heartwood and pupate behind a plug of excelsior-like frass. The larval
galleries are from one-fourth to one-half inch in diameter, and six to ten
inches long. Usually the galleries are within six inches of the center of
the tree. The adult emerges at the lower end of the tunnel, using a hole
cut through the bark by the larva just prior to pupating. Adults emerge
in June and July. The timing of
the two-year life cycle of the red
oak borer is such that the adult
population is greatest in odd-numbered
years.</p>
<p>Generally, borers such as the red
oak borer infest trees of poor
vigor. It is possible, therefore, to
reduce borer populations by
maintaining vigorous stands and
by removing cull trees.</p>

<h3 id="c20">CARPENTERWORM, <i>Prionoxystus robiniae</i> (Peck)</h3>
<p>The carpenterworm bores in
the wood of living hardwood
trees, causing costly damage to
commercial timber species. In
the South, oak species are preferred
hosts but black locust,
maples, willows, and fruit
trees are also attacked. The
carpenterworm is distributed
throughout the United States.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig34">
<img src="images/i012.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="333" />
<p class="pcap">Carpenterworm adults.</p>
</div>
<p>Adult moths emerge in late
April to early June, mate, and the females lay groups of eggs in bark
crevices or wounds. Each female lays 200 to 500 eggs during her one-week
life span. After hatching, the larvae wander over the bark for a
short time before boring into the inner bark where they feed until
half-grown. The larvae then bore into the sapwood and heartwood,
returning occasionally to feed in the inner bark. The larval period lasts
from two to four years. Pupation usually occurs deep within the heartwood.
Just prior to emergence,
the pupa wiggles to the entrance
hole where it remains slightly
protruding until the adult moth
emerges. The large winding tunnels
constructed by the larvae in
the sapwood and heartwood of
living hardwoods serve as an entrance
for wood-rotting fungi
and insects such as the carpenter
ant. In extreme cases, the tree
may be structurally weakened
and subject to wind breakage.</p>

<h3 id="c21">PINE WEBWORM, <i>Tetralopha robustela</i> (Zell.)</h3>
<p>Ugly, compact masses of brown excrement or frass pellets around the
stem of pine seedlings mark infestations of the pine webworm. Rarely is
the defoliation severe enough to kill the seedlings, but it undoubtedly
has an impact on growth. Found throughout the eastern United States,
the webworm commonly attacks red, white, jack, loblolly, shortleaf,
and slash pines.</p>

</div>
<p>The adult moth has a wingspread of about one inch. The forewing
usually is gray in the middle portion and darker at the base and tip. The
hind wings and body are smokey gray. The full-grown larva is a caterpillar
approximately &#8536; of an inch long. The head is tan with darker
markings and the body light brown with dark longitudinal stripes
running down each side.</p>
<p>Eggs are usually laid on seedlings, occasionally on larger trees, between
May and September. After eggs hatch, the caterpillars live in silken
webs surrounded by masses of frass, and feed on the needles. Generally
each web contains one or two larvae but occasionally 25 or more may
be found. After feeding is completed, the caterpillars drop to the
ground and pupate below the soil surface. In the South, there are
usually two generations each year.</p>
<p>In plantations, hand picking is an effective method of control. When
high value nursery stock becomes infested, chemical control may
become necessary.</p>

<h3 id="c22">BAGWORM, <i>Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis</i> (Haw.)</h3>
<p>The bagworm is distributed throughout the eastern half of the United
States. It is generally recognized as a defoliator of conifers, particularly
juniper, cedars, and arborvitae, but it is also found on many hardwood
trees including maple, wild cherry, poplars, oaks, and apple.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig38">
<img src="images/i013.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="558" />
<p class="pcap">Bagworm cases on pine.</p>
</div>
<p>The wingless, maggot-like adult
female bagworms are present in
September and October and
spend their entire lives within the
protective cover of the tough,
silken bag which they construct
as larvae. Males are quite agile
fliers and can often be seen in
the fall flying around infested
shrubs in search of a mate.
Mating takes place through the
open end of the bag. Shortly
thereafter the female deposits
her egg mass containing 500 to
1,000 eggs in her pupal case. The
eggs remain in the bag throughout
the winter. In the deep South, hatching can occur as early as April,
but occurs in May or June further north. During the early stage of
development, the larvae, housed in their tiny bags, are quite inconspicuous.
As they mature, the bags become quite noticeable, and the
amount of foliage consumed increases rapidly.</p>
<p>Outbreak populations of bagworm are in most cases quickly reduced by
low winter temperatures and a complex of several parasites. On shrubs
and shade trees around a home, it is often practical to control bagworms
by picking and destroying the bags.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h3 id="c23">PINE COLASPIS, <i>Colaspis pini</i> (Barber)</h3>
<p>Colaspis beetles are found
throughout the Southeast, but
are more common in the Gulf
states. They seem to prefer slash
pine but have been found on
many of the southern pines. The
pine colaspis beetle is not a
serious forest pest but feeding
damage caused by large populations
occasionally produces a
spectacular browning effect of
the needles similar to that caused
by fire.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig39">
<img src="images/i013a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="531" />
<p class="pcap">Adult pine colaspis beetle feeding damage on pine.</p>
</div>
<p>The adult beetles chew the edges
of needles to produce an irregular,
saw-like edge which turns
brown. Occasionally only the
tips of the needles show signs of the infestation. Later, however, the
entire needle may die, causing the whole tree to become brown as
though scorched by fire. Trees that have been attacked do not die, and
little or no growth loss results. Attacks usually occur in early summer;
by late summer the trees appear green and healthy again. This pest is
sporadic in its occurrence and may not develop again in the same area
for several years. The adult female lays her eggs in the soil during the
summer. Larvae hatch and feed on roots of grasses and other vegetation,
and overwinter in this stage. The larvae pupate in the spring;
adults emerge in early summer to feed. There is only one generation a
year.</p>
<p>Under forest conditions, no control measures are recommended for the
pine colaspis beetle. On ornamentals and shade trees, insecticides can be
used to prevent unsightly damage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h3 id="c24">PINE SAWFLY, <i>Neodiprion excitans</i> (Roh.)</h3>
<p>This pine sawfly is found
throughout the southeast from
Virginia to Texas. Loblolly and
shortleaf pine are preferred
hosts, but pond, slash, longleaf,
and Sonderegger pine are also attacked.
The larvae do not do well
on the latter two species. As with
most sawflies, the larvae feed in
groups on the host needles. Generally
the old needles are preferred,
but all of the needles are
eaten when large numbers of
larvae are present. Three or four
young larvae usually encircle a
needle and, starting from the tip,
consume all but a central core.
When nearing maturity they eat the entire needle.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig40">
<img src="images/i014.jpg" alt="" width="572" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Pine sawfly larvae.</p>
</div>
<p>Four or five generations of this sawfly may occur each year. Adult
females begin to lay their eggs in slits cut in the needles during late
March. The eggs hatch in 10-21 days, and the larvae feed for about five
weeks. When mature the larvae usually crawl to the ground and spin a
cocoon in the loose litter at the base of the tree. Although all stages of
the life history can be found at any time during the growing season, the
peak adult emergence occurs in late summer. Larvae from this late
summer generation are responsible for most of the damage which, although
never directly responsible for mortality, may predispose the
trees to attack by other insects (particularly bark beetles) and diseases.</p>
<p>Natural control factors generally bring outbreak populations under control
after one season. Hogs, armadillos, mice, and shrews are reported as
being of significant value in regulating the sawfly population. Insect
parasites, predators, and disease are also effective control agents.</p>

<h3 id="c25">ARKANSAS PINE SAWFLY, <i>Neodiprion taedae linearis</i> (Ross)</h3>
<p>Loblolly and shortleaf pines
are the only trees attacked by
the Arkansas pine sawfly. Periodic
outbreaks of this insect
over large areas in the south-central
states cause substantial
growth losses, but the insects
seldom kill trees.</p>

<img src="images/i014a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="398" />
<p class="pcap">Arkansas pine sawfly larvae.</p>
</div>
<p>This insect has a single generation each year. In the spring, eggs which
have overwintered hatch into tiny caterpillar-like larvae. The larvae feed
in groups for 30-40 days (primarily on the older foliage) before crawling
to the ground and pupating in the topsoil or litter. Adults emerge
during warm days in October and November, mate, and the females
begin laying eggs. Sawflies get their name from the manner in which the
eggs are laid. The female is equipped with a saw-like &ldquo;ovipositor&rdquo; with
which she cuts a slit in the needle into which the egg is inserted. From
two to ten eggs are laid in a single needle. Each female deposits from 90
to 120 eggs.</p>
<p>An important natural control agent of this sawfly is a polyhedral virus
disease that sometimes destroys large numbers of the larvae. Rodents
destroy many cocoons. Several species of larval parasites are also known
to exist. Of these, a parasitic fly, <i>Anthrax sinuosa</i> (Wied.) and an ichneumon
wasp, <i>Exenterus canadensis</i> (Prov.) appear to be the most
important.</p>

<h3 id="c26">VIRGINIA PINE SAWFLY, <i>Neodriprion pratti pratti</i> (Dyar)</h3>
<p>The Virginia pine sawfly is
found from Maryland to
North Carolina, and west to
Illinois. The insect prefers Virginia
and shortleaf pine, but it
will also oviposit and feed on
pitch and loblolly pine.</p>

<p class="pcap">Virginia pine sawfly larva.</p>
</div>
<p>On warm sunny days in late
October and early November,
the adult sawflies emerge from
their cocoons in the litter,
mate, and the females lay eggs. The female is equipped with a saw-like
ovipositor with which she cuts a slit at the edge of a needle and inserts a
small, white, oval egg. Several eggs are usually laid at evenly spaced
intervals in each needle, but in only one needle per fascicle. From 30 to
100 eggs are deposited in this manner by each female. The eggs hatch
the following April and the young larvae feed gregariously on the old
needles. Larval development is usually completed by the time the new
needles come out, giving heavily defoliated trees a tufted appearance.
Mature larvae crawl to the ground and spin cocoons in the litter or
surface soil. They remain as prepupae until late September when
pupation occurs.</p>

<p>Heavy defoliation for two or
more years can weaken trees and
make them more susceptible to
other insects and diseases, particularly
when associated with
drought. In commercial stands
the growth loss caused by several
years of 50% defoliation by this
insect can amount to &#8531; of the
expected growth.</p>
<p>Several parasites, predators, and
a virus attack the Virginia pine
sawfly, but weather conditions

<h3 id="c27">REDHEADED PINE SAWFLY, <i>Neodiprion lecontei</i> (Fitch)</h3>
<p>The redheaded pine sawfly did
not become an important pest
until extensive planting of
pine in pure plantations began
in the 1920&rsquo;s. Since then, outbreaks
in young natural pine
stands and plantations have
been common in the South,
the north-central states, and
eastern states. Feeding is primarily
restricted to the two- and
three-needled pines under
fifteen feet in height. Shortleaf,
loblolly, longleaf, and
slash are the species most commonly
attacked in the southern
states.</p>

<img src="images/i015b.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Redheaded pine sawfly larva.</p>
</div>
<p>In the fall, sawfly larvae drop
to the ground, spin cocoons in
the duff or topsoil, and overwinter as prepupae in a small, brown
cocoon. With the coming of spring, pupation occurs and adult emergence
follows in about two weeks. Some prepupae may remain in a
resting stage for more than one season before emerging. Each female
lays about 120 eggs. She cuts a small slit in the edge of a needle and
deposits a single egg inside each slit. Eggs laid by a single female are
generally clustered on the needles of a single twig. Eggs hatch in three
to five weeks, depending on temperature and locality. Larvae feed gregariously
on the host for 25 to 30 days. When fully grown, larvae drop
to the ground and spin their cocoons. In the South there are at least
two generations per year with a maximum of five being recorded. Colonies
of different ages may co-exist in the late fall or early winter.</p>
<p>Outbreaks occur periodically and tend to subside after a few years of
heavy defoliation. Numerous parasitic and predatory insects play an
important role in causing the decline of infestations, as do adverse
weather conditions during the larval stage. When deemed necessary,
chemical treatment is an effective control.</p>

<h3 id="c28">TEXAS LEAF-CUTTING ANT, <i>Atta texana</i> (Buckley)</h3>
<p>Damage caused by the Texas
leaf-cutting ant, or town ant, is
confined in the United States to
southeast Texas and west-central
Louisiana. The ant causes
damage to a variety of green
plants throughout the year and
causes serious damage to pine
seedlings during the winter when
other green plants are scarce.
During this period, stands of
young seedlings may be completely
defoliated and the stems
girdled. The ant carries bits of
needles, buds, and bark back to
its nest to serve as the medium

<p class="pcap">Texas leaf cutting ant.</p>
</div>
<p>Ant colonies are characterized by numerous crescent-shaped mounds
five to fourteen inches high, and by a series of well defined foraging
trails cleared of vegetation. The mounds may be confined to a relatively
small area or extend over an acre or more. Each mound serves as the
entrance to a football-sized, hemispherical-shaped nest which the ants
construct at depths up to 20 feet below the surface. The nests are
interconnected by a series of narrow tunnels, and connected to lateral
foraging tunnels which may surface a hundred yards or more from the
colony. Leaf-cutting ants, like many other social insects, are segregated
into castes. The queen dominates the colony and is responsible for its
reproduction. Large worker ants, or soldiers, provide protection from
intrusion by other insects, while the smaller workers collect the leaves
and tend the fungus gardens.</p>
<p>Various chemicals such as fumigants, contact poisons, and baits have
been used to control the leaf-cutting ants with varying success. No
natural control has yet been found.</p>

<h3 id="c29">SOUTHERN PINE BEETLE, <i>Dendroctonus frontalis</i> (Zimm.)</h3>
<p>Probably no other insect is of more concern
to managers of southern pine forests than the
southern pine beetle. Loblolly and shortleaf
pine seem to be preferred hosts, but all of the
southern pines may be attacked wherever
they occur in North and Central America.</p>
<p>Adult beetles are about the size of a grain of
rice, stout and reddish-brown in color. While
they commonly attack lightning-struck or
weakened trees, they can also quickly build
up to high populations capable of successfully
attacking healthy trees during periods favorable
to their development. Adult beetles bore
directly through the bark, mate, and the
females begin to excavate S-shaped egg galleries
in the inner bark. Eggs are deposited in
niches on either side of these galleries and
hatch into small legless grubs within four to
nine days. The grubs mine for a short distance
before boring into the outer bark where they
pupate. There are from three to seven generations
per year depending on locality and
weather. Drought seems to be associated with
major outbreaks of this insect.</p>

<h3 id="c30">IPS ENGRAVER BEETLES, <i>Ips</i> spp.</h3>
<p>With the possible exception of the
southern pine beetle, no other insects
cause as much mortality to
southern pine forests as do the
three species of <i>Ips</i> engravers.
Usually they attack severely weakened
trees, lightning-struck trees, or
fresh slash left by logging operations.
During drought periods they
can successfully attack otherwise
healthy pines.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig49">
<img src="images/i017.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="499" />
<p class="pcap">Pine showing typical symptoms of <span class="u">Ips</span> attack.</p>
</div>
<p>Attacked trees are quickly girdled
by the adults as they construct
their egg galleries in the inner bark.
Death is usually hastened by the introduction of blue-stain fungi
which blocks the flow of sap. Small reddish pitch tubes are frequently
the first sign of attack, but they are usually absent in trees suffering
from drought. Peeling back the bark of an infested tree will reveal
typical Y- or H-shaped egg galleries with short larval galleries extending
perpendicular to them on either side. <i>Ips</i> beetles are easily recognized
by their &ldquo;scooped out&rdquo; posteriors which are surrounded by varying
numbers of tooth-like projections. It takes only 18-25 days to complete
one generation, allowing populations of these beetles to increase very
rapidly during favorable conditions.</p>
<p>At present the best control is the speedy removal and utilization of
actively infested trees, making sure that the bark and slabs are
destroyed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<h3 id="c31">BLACK TURPENTINE BEETLE, <i>Dendroctonus terebrans</i> (Oliv.)</h3>
<p>The black turpentine beetle is found from
New Hampshire south to Florida, and
from West Virginia to east Texas. It is a
particularly serious pest in the Gulf States
where recent outbreaks have killed large
acreages of timber. Attacks have been observed
on all pines native to the Southeast,
and also on red spruce.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig50">
<img src="images/i017a.jpg" alt="" width="421" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Life stages of the black turpentine beetle: adult, callow adult, pupa, larva and eggs.</p>
</div>
<p>This is the largest of the southern bark
beetles, varying in length from &#8533; to &#8531;
of an inch, or about the size of a raisin.
They are reddish-brown to black in color.
The beetle attacks fresh stumps and living
trees by boring through the bark and constructing
galleries on the face of the sapwood
where eggs are laid. Fifty to 200
eggs are laid in a group. They hatch into
white larvae which feed on the inner bark.
The beetle may girdle trees when several
broods occur at approximately the same
height, killing the trees. From 70 to 90
percent of the trees attacked by the beetle die.</p>
<p>After the larvae complete their development, they pupate. Adult
beetles emerge and infest more pine trees. The entire life cycle takes
from 2&frac12; to 4 months, depending on temperature. In the insect&rsquo;s
southern range there usually are two generations and part of a third
each year. In its northern range, the third generation does not develop;
consequently the beetle is not a serious pest there.</p>
<p>Weather is probably the most influential
factor in regulating the numbers
of this insect. During outbreaks the removal
or chemical treatment of infested
trees helps to keep losses to a
minimum.</p>

<h3 id="c32">AMBROSIA BEETLE, <i>Platypus flavicornis</i> (F.)</h3>
<p>Ambrosia beetles are represented
in the South by several species of
the genus <i>Platypus</i> of which only
<i>P. flavicornis</i> (F.) is known to attack
dead or dying southern
pines. <i>P. flavicornis</i> (F.) will secondarily
invade other conifers
and on some occasions may be
found in hardwood trees. It is so
abundant in the South that few
dying pines, stumps, or logs escape
attack. The beetle is found
from Texas east to Florida and
north to New Jersey.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig52">
<img src="images/i018.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="375" />
<p class="pcap">Adult of the <span class="u">Platypus</span> ambrosia beetle.</p>
</div>
<p>The adult is a reddish-brown elongate beetle approximately one-fourth
inch in length. The male of the species has a pair of blunt tooth-like
structures on the third abdominal segment. Several males are usually
found in the presence of a single female. This species requires moist
wood which is favorable to the growth of fungi upon which they feed.
The adults bore into sapwood or heartwood of logs and lumber, making
pin-sized holes which are stained by the ambrosia fungus. The female
lays eggs in small clusters in the tunnel and the developing larvae excavate
tiny cells extending from the tunnel parallel to the grain of
wood. There may be several generations a year.</p>
<p>Ambrosia beetle damage to green sawlogs and lumber may result in
considerable degrade and strength reduction. The best control is rapid
utilization of dead or dying trees. Lumber should be seasoned as soon
as possible to reduce or eliminate losses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h3 id="c33">SOUTHERN PINE SAWYERS, <i>Monochamus</i> spp.</h3>
<p>In the South, dying pines and
fresh logs are quickly attacked
by the pine sawyers. In sufficient
numbers they may cause
a significant loss of wood fiber
and degrade sawlogs. These
species are commonly found
in the South infesting southern
pine, fir, and spruce
wherever the hosts grow.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig53">
<img src="images/i018a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="440" />
<p class="pcap">Adult southern pine sawyer beetle.</p>
</div>
<p>The adults emerge in the
spring or summer and begin to
feed on the bark of twigs.
After mating, the female
gnaws pits through the bark of
freshly felled or dying pine. The female beetle lays one to several eggs
in each pit. After eggs hatch the larvae bore beneath the bark for 40-60
days, converting the inner bark into coarse, shredded frass. The larvae
then enter the wood and make deep U-shaped cells through the heartwood
and sapwood. The entrance is plugged with frass and the far end
is excavated into a pupal chamber. The larvae pupate the following
spring or early summer, transform into adults, and emerge that same
season. The insect has two or three generations per year in the South.</p>
<p>Pine sawyers render storm- or fire-damaged pines unfit for salvage and
are also a problem in wood-holding yards. Rapid salvage and utilization
of dead or dying trees or green logs will reduce losses significantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<h3 id="c34">NANTUCKET PINE TIP MOTH, <i>Rhyacionia frustrana</i> (Comstock)</h3>
<p>The impact of the Nantucket
pine tip moth on pine plantations
varies widely with tree
species, host vigor, and environmental
factors. Heavily infested
trees may be severely stunted or
deformed but mortality is rare.
Generally, the tree grows out of
the susceptible stage within a few
years. In seed orchards, the tip
moth is receiving increasing attention
because of its impact on
height growth and, more importantly,
because of its effect on
flower and cone production. All
species of pine within the range
of the tip moth except white
pine and longleaf pine, are attacked. It has been reported from all states
in the eastern hard-pine region extending across east Texas, Oklahoma,
Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and southern New York State.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig54">
<img src="images/i019.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="526" />
<p class="pcap">Nantucket pine tip moth larva on pine bud.</p>
</div>
<p>The tip moths overwinter as pupae in the tips of infested trees. In the
South the adults emerge on warm
days during the late winter months,
mate, and the females lay eggs in
the axils between needles and stem
near the terminal bud of host trees.
On hatching, larvae bore first into
the base of developing needles, and
later into the new terminal growth
or buds. There are two to four generations
per year in the southern
part of the tip moth&rsquo;s range.</p>
<p>Chemical control is generally not
considered practical in forest plantations,
but several pesticides have
proved effective in reducing insect
damage in seed orchards.</p>

<h3 id="c35">PALES WEEVIL, <i>Hylobius pales</i> (Hbst.)</h3>
<p>Pales weevil is perhaps the most serious insect
pest of pine reproduction in the southeastern
United States. Losses in susceptible areas
commonly run 20-25 percent, but exceed 90
percent under circumstances favoring weevil
development. Pales weevil is found throughout
pine-growing regions of eastern United
States and Canada. Feeding has been reported
on most coniferous species, and all species of
southern pines appear to be susceptible in
varying degrees.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig56">
<img src="images/i019b.jpg" alt="" width="395" height="699" />
<p class="pcap">Pitch-eating weevils in the genera <span class="u">Pachylobius</span>, <span class="u">Hylobius</span>, and <span class="u">Pissodes</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Adult weevils are attracted by the odor of
fresh pine resin, and quickly invade logging
areas. Eggs are laid in lateral roots of fresh
pine stumps, where they hatch in approximately
five to ten days. Larvae feed on the
inner-bark tissues of roots. At maturity, larvae
usually construct a chip cocoon in a chamber
cut into the wood, and pupate in the cocoon.
On emerging, adults feed on the tender bark
of seedlings, or twigs of trees. The small irregular
feeding patches in the bark are characteristic
of weevil damage. Heavy feeding girdles the stem or twig,
causing wilting and eventual death. Newly emerged adult females feed
for approximately one month before laying eggs. Females may lay eggs
sporadically through two growing seasons. The average female lays
about 50 eggs in her lifetime. In the South there are two peaks in adult
weevil population each year; the first occurs in the early spring (March-May)
followed by a second somewhat lower peak in July and August.</p>
<p>This insect can be controlled by delaying planting in cut-over areas for
at least nine months, or by treating seedlings with a suitable insecticide.</p>

<h3 id="c36">WHITE PINE WEEVIL, <i>Pissodes strobi</i> (Peck)</h3>
<p>The white pine weevil is generally
regarded as the most serious insect
pest of white pine. Although it
usually does not cause mortality,
trees suffering repeated attacks become
stunted and deformed to the
point of being commercially unusable.
The weevil has become such a
problem in some areas that it prohibits
the growing of white pine. In
addition to eastern white pine, the
white pine weevils also attack Norway
spruce and jack pine. Other
pines and spruces are attacked to a
lesser degree. The weevil is found
throughout the range of eastern
white pine.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig58">
<img src="images/i020.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="599" />
<p class="pcap">Pine leader damaged by the white pine weevil.</p>
</div>
<p>During the latter half of April, the adults may be found on the terminal
shoots of host trees where the female lays her eggs. Up to 200 eggs
are deposited over a six-week period. The eggs are laid in feeding punctures
in the bark, and hatch about two weeks later. Characteristically,
the young larvae position themselves around the shoot and begin
feeding as a group down the terminal through the inner bark. Small
holes scattered over the bark are characteristic of white pine weevil
attacks. After five or six weeks the larvae construct pupal chambers in
the pith or wood of the terminal shoot and transform into adults. The
young adults remain in the dead terminal until late October and
November when they move to favorable overwintering sites on the
ground, usually at the base of the host tree.</p>
<p>Control of the white pine weevil is difficult. It is possible, however, to
reduce the damage by making conditions in a young stand unfavorable
for egg laying. This is possible because the female weevil will only lay
eggs within a rather narrow range of temperature and relative humidity.
Various techniques involving the use of shade from &ldquo;nurse trees&rdquo; have
been developed but require intensive management. Under certain circumstances,
chemical control can be used.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h3 id="c37">PITCH-EATING WEEVIL, <i>Pachylobius picivorus</i> (Germar)</h3>
<p>In the Gulf Coast States the pitch-eating weevil is probably the most
troublesome insect pest of pine seedlings. No accurate figures are available
on the damage directly attributable to this pest, but mortality
losses are estimated to average about 30 percent in susceptible areas. All
of the southern hard pines and other conifers are probably suitable
breeding and host material for the pitch-eating weevil. Its range overlaps
that of the pales weevil, being reported from Labrador, Canada, south
to Florida and west to Texas. It occurs in damage-causing numbers
only in the Gulf Coast States.</p>
<p>Pitch-eating weevils breed in the roots of freshly cut stumps. The adults
burrow down through the soil, sometimes a considerable distance from
the stump, and lay their eggs in niches chewed in the root bark. On
hatching, larvae mine the inner bark, packing their galleries with frass.
Pupal cells are excavated in the sapwood, and a chip cocoon is constructed
from the excelsior-like material removed during the cells&rsquo; construction.
Development time varies from six to ten months depending
on when the stumps are initially infested. Emerging adult pitch-eating
weevils feed by night on the tender bark of seedlings. Small irregular
patches of bark are removed, eventually girdling the seedling and
causing its death. The pitch-eating weevil exhibits a population trend
similar to that of the pales weevil, and is a threat mostly in early spring
and in the fall.</p>
<p>The most effective control for pine reproduction weevils is to wait nine
months before replanting or until the stumps in an area are no longer
attractive to the weevil. Chemical control can be used when such a
delay is considered impractical.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h3 id="c38">DEODAR WEEVIL, <i>Pissodes nemorensis</i> (Germ.)</h3>
<p>This snout beetle is very
similar to the white pine
weevil both in appearance and
habits. It is found throughout
the south- and mid-Atlantic
states from southern New Jersey
west to Missouri. Although
deodar cedar is the preferred
host, Atlas cedar, Lebanon
cedar, and several species of
southern pines are also
attacked.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig59">
<img src="images/i021.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="421" />
<p class="pcap">Galleries and chip cocoons of the deodar weevil.</p>
</div>
<p>Adults emerge from April to
May and feed briefly on the inner bark of leaders and lateral branches
of host trees. Heavy feeding frequently girdles the stem and can kill
small trees. The adults are dormant during the summer, but resume
activity in the fall to lay their eggs. From one to four eggs are deposited
in feeding punctures. The newly hatched larvae bore into the inner bark
where they construct winding galleries which girdle the stem. Evidence
of such infestations is often delayed until January when the branches
begin to turn brown. Winter is spent in the larval stage. The larvae
pupate in March or April and the cycle is complete.</p>
<p>Keeping shade trees in a vigorous condition by proper watering and
fertilization helps reduce their susceptibility to weevil attack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<h3 id="c39">CONEWORMS, <i>Dioryctria</i> spp.</h3>
<p>Coneworms are perhaps the most
destructive insect pests of pine
cones in the South. They are
particularly serious in superior-tree
seed orchards where they
frequently cause substantial
economic loss. There are five
important species of coneworms
in the South, one or more of
which attack all of the native and
exotic pines.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig60">
<img src="images/i021a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="482" />
<p class="pcap">Coneworm larva feeding on a pine shoot.</p>
</div>
<p>Although the number of generations
per year varies with the
species, their general life history
is similar. Female moths lay their
eggs around wounds, cankers, galls, etc., but also deposit particularly on
terminal growth. Eggs generally hatch in about a week. Larvae may stay
at a single feeding site, or move to several different sites before completing
their development. This latter behavior often results in a single
larva destroying several cones or shoots. Pupation takes place in a
chamber constructed by the larva at the feeding site. Depending on the
species and time of year, the adult may emerge in two to three weeks or
overwinter in the pupal stage. Coneworms cause several kinds of damage.
They may mine through the inner bark, bore up the center of a
shoot, or completely hollow
out a cone. Their attacks are
sometimes marked by fecal
pellets and large pitch masses.</p>

<p>Several parasites attack coneworms
but are seldom effective
enough to prevent population

adequate protection of the
cone crop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h3 id="c40">PINE SEEDWORMS, <i>Laspeyresia</i> spp.</h3>
<p>Until recent years little has been
known about pine seedworms.
These insects are found throughout
the South but seldom have
population explosions. An exception
to this is on slash pine in
Florida where over 70 percent of
one year&rsquo;s cones were reported
infested. Longleaf pine cones in
Texas and Louisiana have also
had over 60 percent cone infestation
on occasion. Loblolly and
shortleaf pine cones are seldom
over 20 percent infested. Seedworms
have been found infesting
longleaf, loblolly, shortleaf,
slash, and Virginia pine cones.
<i>Laspeyresia anaranjada</i> Miller attacks primarily slash pine, occasionally
longleaf pine, and rarely loblolly pine. <i>L. ingens</i> Heinrick attacks
primarily longleaf and slash pine. <i>L. toreuta</i> Grote attacks Virginia,
shortleaf, and loblolly pine in the South.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig62">
<img src="images/i022.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="575" />
<p class="pcap">Adult pine seedworm.</p>
</div>
<p>The female moth lays eggs from April through May on second-year
cones. There is one generation per year. Larvae feed within developing
seeds until the cone matures. In late fall, larvae either bore into the
cone axis or remain in a hollowed-out seed, and overwinter. Pupation
occurs within the cone and moths emerge through the hollow seeds.
External evidence of seedworm
attack is not visible in
immature cones. As cones
mature, damaged seeds are
retained in the cone. Heavily
damaged cones do not open
properly. In high-value seed
orchards and seed production
areas some protection from
seedworm attack may be obtained
through the use of pesticides
applied in a carefully
timed program.</p>

<p class="pcap">Eggs and wool-covered adult balsam woolly aphids.</p>
</div>
<p>The balsam woolly aphid was
introduced into northeastern
North America from Europe
around the turn of the century.
Since then it has become a pest
of major importance to true firs
on the east and west coasts of
the continent, and threatens
some 60,000 acres of Fraser fir
in the southern Appalachians.
Usually the balsam woolly aphid
has two generations per year in
the southern Appalachians. Eggs
of the first generation hatch in
late June and July followed by
the second generation in September
and October. The immature
stage of the aphid known as a
&ldquo;crawler&rdquo; is the only motile
stage in the aphid&rsquo;s life cycle.
Once the crawler begins feeding,
it transforms into an adult and
never again moves. Reproduction
is parthenogenic with each female laying approximately 100 eggs during
her lifetime.</p>
<p>In the feeding process the aphid injects a salivary substance into the
host tree, which causes growth abnormalities. Initial symptoms of aphid
attack may include &ldquo;gouting&rdquo; of buds or twig nodes and some twig and
branch die-back. Heavy stem
attacks reduce the tree&rsquo;s
ability to translocate food and
water. Usually a heavily infested
tree dies within two to
seven years.</p>
<p>Chemical control is effective
but extremely costly and thus
limited to very high-value
areas along scenic road-ways.
Other control measures include
removal and destruction
of infested material.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<h3 id="c42">NEEDLE CAST</h3>
<p>Needle cast is a very common
disease of conifers throughout
eastern and southern United
States. Eastern white, loblolly,
longleaf, pitch, pond, shortleaf,
table mountain, and Virginia
pines are all susceptible. <i>Hypoderma
lethale</i> is probably the
most common cause of needle
cast on the above hosts, with the
exception of longleaf pine.
<i>Lophodermium pinastri</i> is also
associated with needle cast.</p>

<img src="images/i023.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="422" />
<p class="pcap">Hypoderma needle cast on loblolly pine.</p>
</div>
<p>Current pine needles are infected in the early summer, and by winter or
early spring begin to turn brown at the tips. At this time the tree
usually has a scorched appearance. Later, the browning progresses down
the needle and the fungal fruiting bodies are produced. These are small,
black, elongated structures known as hysterothecia, which open along a
slit during moist weather to release their spores. The infected needles
are often &ldquo;cast,&rdquo; leaving only the new growth, and causing the tree to
have a tufted appearance.</p>
<p>Controls are seldom needed for this disease in forest stands. Infected
trees usually recover and put out new foliage the year following heavy
attacks. Nurseries or plantations should not be established in areas
where needle cast is prevalent.</p>

All southern pines are attacked
by the fungus, but only longleaf
pine seedlings are seriously
damaged.</p>

<p class="pcap">Brown spot needle blight on longleaf pine reproduction.</p>
</div>
<p>Initial infection of pine needles
results in the development of
small, circular spots of grey green
color, which later turn brown. As
the fungus continues to grow, a
necrotic area encircles the
needle, appearing as a brown
band. The infected area will then
increase in size, eventually resulting in the death of the needle. Fruiting
bodies, called acervuli, develop in the dead areas of the needle. Spores
are extruded from the acervuli in a water soluble gelatinuous matrix
throughout the entire year. The spores are washed apart and splashed
short distances by rain drops. These spores spread the disease from
seedling to seedling. During the winter and early spring, the sexual stage
of the fungus is produced on dead needles. Ascospores, produced in a
fruiting body called a perithecium, are light and wind-disseminated.
These spores are responsible for disease spread. During the grass stage,
seedlings often become heavily infected by the brown spot fungus,
resulting in partial to complete defoliation. Seedlings which are nearly
defoliated every year remain in the grass stage and eventually die. Three
successive years of complete defoliation will result in death. The disease
is very damaging during wet years, especially in areas where the fungus
has become well established in the absence of controls.</p>
<p>The disease can be reduced by control burning during the winter
months. On seedlings, fire burns the diseased needles and reduces the
amount of available inoculum for reinfection, leaving the large terminal
bud unharmed. Often a single prescribed burn reduces the disease intensity
to such low levels that vigorous seedling height growth begins the
following year. Fungicide sprays will also reduce brown spot on high
valued trees.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fruiting bodies of pine needle rust on loblolly pine.</p>
</div>
<p>Nearly all the native pines in southern United States are attacked by
various needle rust fungi of the genus <i>Coleosporium</i>. This disease is very
common, but causes little harm to the trees. Many species of this rust
also attack broadleaved weeds in addition to the pines, needing both
host types to complete their life cycle.</p>
<p>Needle rusts are most prevalent on young trees in the seedling to sapling
stage. In the spring or early summer small, delicate white fungus &ldquo;cups&rdquo;
filled with yellow to orange spores are produced on the needles. From a
distance entire seedlings may appear to have a whitish or yellowish cast.
Individual needles which are heavily infected may die, turn brown, and
drop from the tree. However, the entire tree is rarely defoliated. Small
red &ldquo;rust pustules&rdquo; form on the undersurface of the weed leaves. These
are replaced by dark structures later in the summer.</p>
<p>The needle rusts are not important enough to warrant control in natural
forests or plantations. If the weed (alternate) host is known, it can be
eradicated around nurseries of susceptible pine species. However, it
would be better to establish nurseries in rust free areas.</p>

<h3 id="c45">CEDAR APPLE RUST</h3>
<p>Cedar apple rust, caused by <i>Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae</i>, is
important commercially in the apple-growing regions of the Virginias,
Carolinas, and the Mississippi Valley. The alternate hosts of this rust are
eastern red cedar and several species of junipers.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fruiting on apple leaf the alternate host.</p>
</div>
<p>Cedar &ldquo;apples&rdquo; or galls are the characteristic signs of the fungus on
cedars. Cedar needles are infected in the summer by wind-borne spores
from apple leaves. By the next spring or early summer galls begin to
appear as small greenish brown swellings on the upper needle surfaces.
By fall, the infected needle turns into a chocolate brown gall covered
with small circular depressions. The following spring, orange jelly-like
tendrils protrude from the galls producing an attractive ornament for
the cedar tree. Spores produced from these orange spore masses are
then capable of reinfecting apple leaves, thus completing the fungus life
cycle.</p>
<p>No practical control of the rust on cedars is available because of the low
value of cedar. However, considerable effort is expended to protect
apple trees. Where apple is to be protected, cedars should be eliminated
in the vicinity or, rust galls should be picked or cut off cedars before
the galls mature.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<h3 id="c46">CEDAR BLIGHT</h3>
<p>Cedar blight, caused by <i>Phomopsis juniperovora</i>, is most severe on eastern
red and Rocky Mountain cedars. Other hosts include arborvitae,
cypress, and Atlantic white cedar. The disease ranges from the mid-West
to the Atlantic coast and south to Alabama where it is most common in
nurseries.</p>

</div>
<p>Symptoms on red cedar resemble that of drought. The tips of branches
are killed back and sometimes entire trees will turn brown. The fungus
forms black fruiting bodies on needles and stem lesions. Fungus spores
are distributed by rainwater; nursery overhead sprinkling systems also
facilitate blight spread.</p>
<p>Control of cedar blight is initiated by removing and burning infected
nursery stock early in the season before infection becomes heavy. Seedbeds
should be well drained. Avoid introducing cedar stock to an infected
nursery. The location of cedars in the nursery should be changed
frequently and, where possible, cedar beds should be kept well away
from older cedar or cedar hedges. Seedlings growing in low-density seed
beds are more vulnerable to the blight; thus beds should be fully
stocked. Cedar mulch should never be used on cedar beds. Avoid
wounding nursery transplants. No economically feasible control is available
for forest stands.</p>

<p class="pcap">Damage caused by fusiform rust infection.</p>
</div>
<p>Fusiform rust, caused by <i>Cronartium fusiforme</i>, is one of the most
important diseases on southern pines. This rust is found from Maryland
to Florida and west to Texas and southern Arkansas. The rust&rsquo;s most
important impact is in nurseries, seed orchards, and young plantations.
Loblolly and slash pines are very susceptible to this rust. Pitch and
pond pines are moderately susceptible, longleaf pine is fairly resistant,
and shortleaf pine is highly resistant.</p>
<p>The most easily recognized symptom is the spindle-shaped canker on
the pine branches or main stem. In early spring these swellings appear
yellow to orange as the fungus produces
powdery spores. As host tissue
is killed, older stem cankers may
become flat or sunken. Cankers often
girdle trees and wind breakage at the
canker is common. Fungus spores
from the pine infect oak leaves.
Brown hair-like structures, produced
on the underside of the leaves in late
spring, are the most conspicuous signs.
These projections produce spores
which in turn reinfect the pine trees,
completing a &ldquo;typical&rdquo; rust cycle.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig77">
<img src="images/i025e.jpg" alt="" width="587" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Fruiting fusiform-shaped canker on main stem of southern pine.</p>
</div>
<p>Silvicultural practices may lessen the
incidence of infection in plantations.
Avoid planting highly susceptible
species such as slash and loblolly pines in areas of known high rust
incidence. In these areas more resistant species such as longleaf or shortleaf
pine should be planted. Pruning infected branches will prevent stem
infection in young plantations. Rust-resistant pines should be readily
available from the nurseries in the near future. Culling out seedlings
with obvious galls before outplanting will reduce the disease incidence
in new plantations.</p>

<h3 id="c48">WHITE PINE BLISTER RUST</h3>
<p>White pine blister rust, caused by <i>Cronartium ribicola</i>, was introduced
to North America on nursery stock about 1900. It is the most important
disease on white pine in the United States. In the South, the
disease is found on eastern white pine in the Appalachian mountains.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig78">
<img src="images/i026.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="441" />
<p class="pcap">Fruiting cankers showing yellow-colored spores of blister rust on eastern white pine.</p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig79">
<img src="images/i026a.jpg" alt="(cont.)" width="600" height="441" />
</div>
<p>The disease is caused by a fungus that attacks both white pine and wild
and cultivated currant and gooseberry bushes, called <i>Ribes</i>. Both hosts
must be present if the fungus is to complete its life cycle. Attack by the
disease is followed by the development of cankers on the main stem or
branches. Infected pines die when a canker completely girdles the main
stem or when many of the branches are killed by girdling. The most
conspicuous symptoms of the disease are the dying branches or crowns
(&ldquo;flags&rdquo;) above the girdling cankers, and the cankers themselves.</p>
<p>Initially, a narrow band of yellow-orange bark marks the edges of the
canker. Inside this band are small irregular dark brown scars. As the
canker grows, the margin and bank of dark scars expand and the portion
formerly occupied by the dark scars is now the area where the
spores that infect <i>Ribes</i> are produced. During the months of April
through June white sacs or blisters containing orange-yellow spores
(called aeciospores) push through the diseased bark. The blisters soon
rupture and the orange-yellow spores are wind-dispersed for great distances.
Generally, there is some tissue swelling associated with the canker,
which results in a spindle-shaped swelling around the infected portion
of the stem.</p>
<p>Loss of white pines from blister rust can be prevented by destroying the
wild and cultivated <i>Ribes</i> bushes. Bushes may be removed by uprooting
by hand, grubbing with a hand tool, or with herbicides. Pruning infected
branches on young trees will prevent stem infections and
probably tree mortality.</p>

<p class="pcap">Alternate host&mdash;false toadflax.</p>
</div>
<p>Comandra blister rust, caused by the fungus <i>Cronartium comandrae</i>, is
a canker disease of hard pines. The disease presently occurs in widely
scattered areas throughout the western, central, and southern United
States. In the South, the primary hosts are loblolly, shortleaf, pond,
and Virginia pine. Herbaceous plants of the genus Comandra, commonly
known as false toadflax or comandra, are also attacked.</p>
<p>The fungus infects pines through the needles and grows from the needle
into the branch or main stem where it forms a gall or canker. Dark
orange-colored spores which are produced on the surface of the gall in
the spring are wind-blown and infect the leaves or stems of the comandra
plants. Two to three weeks after infection, urediospores are produced
on the underside of the comandra leaf. These are wind-blown
and can only infect other comandra plants. Eventually hair-like structures
known as telia are produced on the comandra leaves and stems.
The telia produce spores which are wind-blown and infect the pine host
through the needle. The necessary combination of a susceptible pine
host, the alternate host, and the pathogen is presently known to occur
only in northern Arkansas, eastern Tennessee, and northern Alabama.</p>
<p>No effective method of controlling the disease in forest stands is presently
known. Silvicultural or forest management practices which reduce
the abundance of the alternate host offer promise of long term control.
Maintenance of dense stands and heavy ground cover as a means of
shading out the intermediate host plants, may be helpful in reducing
rust damage in many areas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<h3 id="c50">EASTERN GALL RUST</h3>
<p>Eastern gall rust, caused by
the fungus <i>Cronartium cerebrum</i>,
attacks many species of
eastern hard pines. The disease
ranges eastward from the
Great Plains and is most severe
in the South on Virginia and
shortleaf pines. Like most
rusts this fungus requires an alternate
host in addition to its
pine host. In this case oaks, especially
the red oak group
(black, red, scarlet and pin)
are the alternate hosts. Damage
to the oaks is generally not
of economic importance as only
the leaves are affected.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig82">
<img src="images/i027.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="480" />
<p class="pcap">Fruiting gall showing red-orange spores on Virginia pine.</p>
</div>
<p>On pines the fungus causes the formation of globose to sub-globose
galls. Canker formation occurs occasionally but mortality generally results
from wind breakage at the gall rather than by canker formation as
literally hundreds of galls may appear on a single tree. They are not
lethal to the tree, but may ruin tree form and on a large stem they can
lead to an open decayed wound, as decay fungi are often secondary
invaders of rust infections. The shape of galls and the arrangement of
the spore sacs filled with red-orange spores present a cerebroid (brain-like)
appearance. During the spring the bright orange galls are very
striking.</p>
<p>This disease is sometimes a problem in nurseries where seedlings are
attacked and killed. This is where control efforts are concentrated.
Fungicide protectants are applied to the seedling foliage to prevent
infection from spores produced on oaks. Contact your local forestry
extension agent or the nearest Division of Forest Pest Management for
the latest recommendations. Under forest conditions, control is not
economically feasible. Trees of poor form should be removed during
thinning operations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<h3 id="c51">SOUTHERN CONE RUST</h3>
<p>Southern cone rust is caused by the fungus <i>Cronartium strobilinum</i>. It
has been reported to completely destroy slash and longleaf pine cone
crops in Georgia and along the Gulf Coast from Florida to Texas.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig83">
<img src="images/i027a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="546" />

</div>
<div class="img" id="fig84">
<img src="images/i027b.jpg" alt="(cont.)" width="600" height="537" />
</div>
<p>Like most other rusts, the fungus requires oaks and pines to complete
its life cycle. Although infection of oak leaves occurs annually, no
significant economic damage is done to the oaks. Fungus spores produced
on oak leaves infect the mature female pine flowers about the
time of pollination (January-February). The fungus grows through the
developing conelet causing it to swell abnormally. By early April or late
May the infected cones are three to four times larger than the normal
first-year cones and even exceed the maturing second-year cones in size.
The swollen cone scales are reddish in color. Cavities in the cone filled
with orange-yellow spores burst and the cones become orange-yellow.
The swollen orange-yellow cones in the tree crowns can be easily distinguished
from normal cones by an observer on the ground. By late
summer most of the diseased cones have died and fallen.</p>
<p>Control at present is confined to seed orchards. Hydraulic spraying of
the flowers with fungicides gives a significant reduction in infections.
Consult your local forester, county extension agent or the nearest
Forest Pest Management Office for current control recommendations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<h3 id="c52">PITCH CANKER</h3>
<p>Pitch canker, caused by the fungus <i>Fusarium lateritium forma pini</i>, is
rapidly becoming widespread throughout the South. The disease apparently
is most serious on Virginia, slash and south Florida slash pine. The
fungus also attacks shortleaf, pitch, and table-mountain pine.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig85">
<img src="images/i028.jpg" alt="" width="565" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Pitch canker infection in terminal branch and main stem of pine.</p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig86">
<img src="images/i028a.jpg" alt="(cont.)" width="600" height="454" />
</div>
<p>Pitch canker may cause tree mortality. On Virginia pines the fungus
reportedly enters through small insect wounds in the twigs or mechanical
wounds in the bole. Shoots may be girdled and killed within a few
weeks, but it takes a period of years for the fungus to girdle the bole of
larger trees. On slash pine the disease apparently attacks plantations in
wave years. During years of heavy attack the fungus can cause rapid
crown deterioration in addition to causing bole canker infections. Cankers
on leaders in the crown can result in death of two-thirds or more
of the crown by mid-summer in a tree that appeared healthy in the
spring. In the majority of tree infections only the leader and one or two
laterals will be infected. The tree recovers in a few years with a crook in
the bole as the only evidence of attack. Pitch cankers usually retain the
bark and old cankers on the hole may be sunken. The most diagnostic
characteristic of the disease, and the one that definitely separates it
from similar disease, is the heavy pitch soak of the wood beneath the
canker. Pitch cankers are often so soaked with pitch that heavy flow of
pitch is observed flowing down the bole.</p>
<p>At the present time, no known method of control exists. Observations
in slash pine plantations indicate that some trees are resistant while
others range in their degree of susceptibility.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<h3 id="c53">WOOD DECAY</h3>
<p>Wood decay of southern forest trees is responsible for nearly 80 percent
of all loss attributed to disease. This decay is caused by fungi which
mainly attack heartwood in the central portion of stems, branches, and
roots. Wood-rotting fungi gain entrance into the tree through broken
branches, wounds, and damaged or exposed roots. Spores, which land
at these damaged areas, germinate and produce a microscopic mycelium
which attacks and spreads throughout the heartwood. The decay is
caused by the action of the mycelium, which penetrate the cell walls
and dissolve or alter the wood in various ways. Fungus development
within the tree may continue for many years without any apparent
effect on the growth of the host. Eventually the mycelium will aggregate
and break through the bark to form the reproductive stage, either
before or after the death of the host. The fruiting body (sporophore,
conk) produces vast amounts of spores which are capable of spreading
the fungus to other trees.</p>
<p>Heartrots may be separated into broad classes on the basis of the host
portion attacked, such as root rots, root and butt rots, stem rots, and
top rots. Decay fungi may be further separated into two broad classes
based on their effect on wood. The first class causes white rots, decomposing
all components of the wood and reducing it to a spongy mass
with white pockets or streaks separated by firm wood. The second
class, causing brown rots, utilize the cellulose, leaving the lignin more or
less unaffected. This usually results in a rot which appears as some
shade of brown.</p>
<p>The separation of wood decay fungi on the basis of their host range, the
portion of the host attacked, and the type of rot produced are useful
aids to a pathologist in determining a tentative identification of the
fungus responsible for a particular type of rot. However, there are
numerous fungi which cause decay, many of which are exceptions to
the various methods of classification. This forces the pathologist to use
microscopic examination and various artificial keys to arrive at the
proper identification of a given rot-producing fungus.</p>

<h3 id="c54">RED HEART</h3>
<p>The fungus, <i>Fomes pini</i>, is the
cause of a heartrot of widespread
distribution. Common
names for the rot produced by
this fungus are: red heart, red
ring rot, or white peck. The
disease is commonly associated
with mature and over-mature
conifers, especially
Douglas fir, larch, spruce, and
pine. In the southern United
States, the fungus attacks all
species of mature pine.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig88">
<img src="images/i029.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="345" />
<p class="pcap">Fruiting body of redheart on southern pine.</p>
</div>
<p>Generally, infection of all hosts occurs through dead branch stubs.
Early stages of decay caused by <i>F. pini</i> are characterized by a discoloration
of the heartwood, often appearing light red to reddish brown.
The advanced stages of heartrot appear as elongated white pockets or
flecks, formed parallel to the grain and separated by apparently firm
wood. Often the pockets become resin filled. On southern pine hosts,
the conks are often bracket-like or hoof-shaped. The upper surface
appears dull grey to dark brown, with concentric furrows parallel to the
margin of the fruiting body. The lower side is a light brown to brownish
gold, rimmed by a velvety golden brown margin. Swollen knots result
from the living wood tissue trying to overgrow the knot where a conk is
forming.</p>

<p>In southern forest stands,
heartrot damage may be reduced
by harvesting mature
pines prior to the age of extreme
susceptibility to fungus
attack. Some degree of shade
tree protection can be obtained
by pruning dead and
dying branches flush with the
main stem. This will allow the
knot to be quickly overgrown
by sap wood, preventing the
heartrot fungus from entering
through the branch stub.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig90">
<img src="images/i029b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="515" />
<p class="pcap">Fomes annosus fruiting bodies on stump.</p>
</div>
<p>Annosus root and butt rot is
caused by the fungus <i>Fomes
annosus</i>. This pathogen is common
throughout coniferous
stands of the North Temperate
Zone. Hardwoods may be attacked,
but damage is usually of
minor consequence. In the
South, the disease is most serious
in pine plantations on sandy soils
with low organic matter. All
species of southern pine are susceptible.
Slash and loblolly plantations
are often severely
affected.</p>
<p>The disease gains entry into plantations by spore infection of freshly
cut stumps during thinnings. The fungus then spreads from the infected
stumps to residual trees by growth along the roots to points of root
contact. Residual trees usually begin to die within a few years after
thinning. The sporophores or fruiting bodies are generally found at
ground line or in the root crotch. Pines in initial stages of the disease
usually exhibit sparsely foliated crowns; however, white pine with full
crown may have extensive butt and root decay. Occasionally trees may
die rapidly with a sudden red discoloration of a nearly full crown.
Diseased trees are often found in groups or circular pockets in the
stand. The indication of <i>F. annosus</i>
decay may include the pink to
violet stain of incipient decay, the
narrow elongated white pockets
and scattered black flecks in the
wood of the early decay stages, and
the yellow stringy rot of the late
stages of decay.</p>

<h3 id="c56">BROWN CUBICAL BUTT ROT</h3>
<p><i>Polyporus schweinitzii</i> is a
common cause of root and
butt rot of conifers
throughout North America.
The primary hosts of the
fungus are Douglas fir,
spruce, and pine. All southern
pines are susceptible to
attack by <i>P. schweinitzii</i>.
Common names of the rot
are: red-brown butt rot and
brown cubical butt rot.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig92">
<img src="images/i030.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="346" />
<p class="pcap">Fruiting body of brown cubical root and butt rot of pine.</p>
</div>
<p>The fungus enters living
hosts through damaged roots, fire scars, and other wounds near the tree
base. The initial stage of decay appears as a light yellow stain. In the
advanced stage, the heartwood becomes brittle and breaks into large
yellow-brown to reddish-brown cubes. The fungus develops primarily in
the roots and butt and seldom extends more than 15 or 20 feet up into
the stem. Diseased trees are subject to wind-throw and wind breakage.
Although the volume of wood destroyed by the rot is small, the total
volume lost through wind-throw is quite large. Mature, suppressed, and
weakened off-site trees are commonly attacked by the fungus. It is
assumed that the fungus may also spread from infected to healthy trees
through root contacts and grafts. The only outward signs of decay are
the annual sporophores, which develop in late summer and fall during
moist weather. Conks formed at the base of infected trees are bracket
shaped, while those arising from decayed roots appear circular, sunken
in the center, and supported by a short stalk. When fresh, the upper
surface is velvety, concentrically zoned, and reddish-brown in color
with a light yellow margin. The underside is dark olive or green with
large irregular pores.</p>
<p>In forest stands, no method of controlling the disease is known. Losses
may be prevented to some extent by reducing the amount of root
damage and wounding from heavy logging equipment. The prevention
of basal fire scars in conifer stands will also reduce the incidence of this
disease. Trees which show signs of advanced root and butt rot should be
removed from around recreation areas, parking lots, power lines, and
buildings to avoid damage from wind-throw and wind breakage.</p>

and Florida.</p>
<p>The fungus is believed to enter living hosts through basal wounds and
damaged roots. Under ideal conditions, the fungus may spread from
infected to healthy trees by way of root contacts or grafts. Growth of
the fungus is very slow, often causing host mortality 20 to 30 years
after initial infection. Wood decayed initially appears firm, but dark
reddish-brown in color. In advanced stages, the wood is flecked with
elliptical white pockets separated by brown-colored wood. Infected
conifers generally express typical root rot symptoms. Trees show evidence
of reduced radial and internodal growth, accompanied by death
of the crown from the base upward. The foliage appears off-color and
reduced in length. Under moist conditions, sporophores are produced
either at the base of infected trees or on the forest floor. Bracket-shaped
sporophores are produced at the base of infected trees while
stipitate conks are produced on the ground directly over infected or
dead roots. Fresh sporophores appear yellow-brown in color from
above with a lighter colored pore surface below.</p>
<p>No effective method of controlling the disease in forest stands is presently
known. However, damage and losses may be reduced by management
practices which reduce or eliminate the chance introduction of
the disease into healthy stands. In areas where red root and butt rot is
common, attempts should be made to conduct logging and thinning
operations during the dry season to avoid mechanical damage to the
root systems of the residual trees.</p>

<h3 id="c58">LITTLELEAF OF PINE</h3>
<p>Littleleaf of pine, caused by <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i>, is the most
serious disease of shortleaf pine in the Piedmont region of the South.
Loblolly is also affected, usually where associated with infected shortleaf
pine. The disease is most evident in older age classes, rarely attacking
stands under 20 years old.</p>

</div>
<div class="img" id="fig95">
<img src="images/i031a.jpg" alt="(cont.)" width="600" height="419" />
</div>
<p>The disease is caused by a malfunctioning of the root system due to
a combination of biological and physical factors. A fungus, <i>Phytophthora
cinnamomi</i> attacks and kills the root tips. When conditions
of moisture, fertility, and drainage are adverse, they reduce tree vigor
and prevent the tree from rapidly replacing the destroyed root tips.
Trees on good sites are reportedly also attacked by the fungus, but
their vigor is such that they quickly overcome the disease by producing
new root tips. The disease usually progresses rather slowly. Some trees
may persist fifteen or more years after the appearance of initial symptoms.
In general, trees live only five or six years after attack, but they
may die in as little as one year. Symptoms are those typical of trees
in stress due to a malfunction of the root system. In the early stage
of the disease the foliage may turn yellow-green and the current year&rsquo;s
needles are shorter than normal. Later stages of the disease are sparsely
foliated crowns with short needles (reduced from three to five to only
one-half to three inches in length) and dead branches. Abundant foliage
sprouting on the hole of infected shortleaf is common.</p>
<p>Losses are minimized by salvage cuttings and by favoring loblolly and
hardwoods in regeneration plans.</p>

<h3 id="c59">SYCAMORE ANTHRACNOSE</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig96">
<img src="images/i031b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="628" />
<p class="pcap">Defoliation of sycamore tree caused by sycamore anthracnose.</p>
</div>
<p>Sycamore anthracnose, caused by
<i>Gnomonia veneta</i>, is common on
American sycamore throughout its
range in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>Anthracnose is a disease characterized
by distinctive limited lesions on stem,
leaf, or fruit, often accompanied by
dieback or blight and usually caused
by fungi that produce slimy spores
that ooze from small cup-shaped fruiting
bodies that are visible with a hand
lens. This disease has four distinct
symptom stages identified as twig
blight, bud blight, shoot blight, and
leaf blight. Twig blight appears before
leaf emergence and kills the tips of
small one-year-old twigs. Infection comes initially from leaf litter and
twig cankers. The second stage, bud blight, develops during bud expansion
in April and early May. Shoot blight, the most frequently
observed symptom, causes the sudden dying of expanding shoots and
also young leaves. Leaf blight, the final stage, involves the actual infection
of expanding or mature leaves. Diseased portions of the leaf involve
irregular brown areas adjacent to the midrib and veins which are
dotted with diseased spots. Incidence of anthracnose is directly related
to the amount of spring rainfall. Shoot blight is severe if the weather
for two weeks after leaf emergence
is cool and moist. The disease may
defoliate trees, which usually put
out a new crop of leaves by late
spring or summer.</p>
<p>Control of sycamore anthracnose
under forest conditions is not economically
feasible. Where the disease
is prevalent, other species should be
favored during thinnings. In shade
and ornamental trees, pruning of infected
twigs, burning of leaves, and
fertilization will reduce the disease
impact.</p>

<h3 id="c60">WALNUT ANTHRACNOSE</h3>
<p>Walnut anthracnose is a fungus disease caused by <i>Gnomonia leptostyla</i>.
This worldwide disease attacks most species of walnut in the United
States. Black walnut is most severely affected, but with favorable
weather for the fungus, even less susceptible individuals may be defoliated.
Butternut, Persian walnut, and two species from California (Hinds
walnut and California walnut) are all susceptible. Anthracnose has also
been reported on species of walnut from most of the European countries,
Argentina, Canada, and South Africa.</p>
<p>Wet weather greatly favors this leaf disease which may defoliate black
walnuts by late July or early August. Defoliation slows growth,
weakens trees, and sometimes causes mortality. Infected leaves reveal
circular spots of dark brown or black. These spots often grow together,
leaving large dead areas. These spots or blotches are bordered with
yellow to golden tissue. While severely affected leaves fall, some &ldquo;anthracnose&rdquo;
leaves remain on the tree. This disease also affects the
growth and quality of the nuts. Nutmeats from infected trees are dark,
unattractive, and shrivelled. Sunken, killed areas appear on the husks as
dark circular spots smaller than those on the leaves. Infected nuts, like
the leaves, may also fall from the tree. Lesions may appear on the
current year&rsquo;s shoots and later form dead sunken areas that are oval to
irregularly circular with reddish brown margins.</p>
<p>As with the other anthracnose diseases, no practical control is available
for forest trees. Control of walnut anthracnose on ornamentals and nut
trees is partially achieved by raking and burning of old leaves.</p>

<h3 id="c61">OAK ANTRHACNOSE</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig98">
<img src="images/i032.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="597" />
<p class="pcap">Leaf symptoms of oak anthracnose.</p>
</div>
<p>Oak anthracnose is caused by the
fungus <i>Gnomonia veneta</i>. Trees
of the white oak group, particularly
white oak, are susceptible
to this disease. Oaks throughout
the entire eastern United States
are affected by the disease,
although it is less common in the
Northeast.</p>
<p>Infection occurs in the early
spring or mid-summer. Symptoms
on leaves develop as irregular
brown diseased areas
(blotches) along the midrib and
the major side veins. These
blotches may grow together by
late spring or early summer if infection
occurs early. Blotches are usually confined to the areas bordered
by the larger veins. Leaves on the lower branches are frequently
killed and occasionally trees will be defoliated. However, a second crop
of leaves soon develops and mortality is rare. Fruiting bodies of <i>Gloeosporium</i>,
the imperfect fungus fruiting stage of anthracnose, are located
on the midrib and veins of infected leaves. When the disease spreads to
the twigs, cankers and crown dieback may occur. The anthracnose fungus
overwinters on diseased twigs and in the leaf litter. Oak anthracnose
has the same causal agent as sycamore anthracnose, and the weather
conditions favoring the sycamore disease also increases the anthracnose
on oak.</p>
<p>Control is similar to sycamore anthracnose and involves an integrated
program of pruning disease tissue, fertilization, and burning of leaf
litter. No practical control is available for forest trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<h3 id="c62">DOGWOOD ANTHRACNOSE</h3>
<p>Dogwood anthracnose, caused by the fungus <i>Elsinoe corni</i>, occurs in
states bordering the Atlantic Ocean and has also been reported in Louisiana.
Its primary host is flowering dogwood, <i>Cornus florida</i> L.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig100">
<img src="images/i033a.jpg" alt="(cont.)" width="600" height="432" />
</div>
<p>Anthracnose occurs in the spring and affects not only the leaves, but
also the buds and &ldquo;flowers&rdquo;. The buds may fail to open or they may
produce stunted flowers. These have many circular to elongated spots
with light tan centers. Margins of these spots are purple to brown.
Often the flowers abort before development. Foliage spots (1-2 mm. in
diameter) are raised at the margins. They are purple at the edges and
yellow-gray in the center. Later centers of spots may fall out causing a
&ldquo;shothole&rdquo; effect. Dozens of spots may be present on a single leaf and
may be scattered or concentrated at tip, margin, or midrib. Twisting
and malformation of the leaves are common. In addition to floral and
foliage spots, infected areas may also occur on petioles, stems, and fruit
clusters. All three areas have spots similar to those on the foliage.</p>
<p>Other diseases which may be confused with anthracnose include
<i>Septoria</i> and <i>Ascochyta</i> leaf spots. <i>Septoria</i> usually begins around July
and unlike anthracnose has more angular lesions that are between the
veins. <i>Ascochyta</i> spots may be larger (6 mm. in diameter) than anthracnose,
and tissue discoloration may extend outside of their borders.
Occasionally the leaves may totally blacken. This disease may occur as
early as June.</p>
<p>Wet, humid weather at certain stages of plant development is required
for infection. Homeowners may obtain effective control by removing
and burning infected plant parts. Various fungicide sprays are recommended
by authors of ornamental handbooks.</p>

<img src="images/i033c.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="397" />
<p class="pcap">Rust infected cottonwood leaf.</p>
</div>
<p>Cottonwood rust, caused by <i>Melampsora medusae</i>, is probably the most
important leaf disease of cottonwoods wherever they are grown. In the
Lower Mississippi Valley, all sizes of eastern cottonwood trees may be
infected with this rust. However, the disease is probably of most importance
in cottonwood nurseries.</p>
<p>In mid-summer, yellow to orange pustules containing spores of the
fungus form on the under surface of the cottonwood leaves. In late
summer and early fall, dark brown fungal growths replace the orange
structures. Cottonwood may be prematurely defoliated or even killed
by successive attacks. The rust may weaken trees and subject them to
attack by other disease-causing organisms. Also, there is often a reduction
in growth in these normally fast growing species. This is very
important since there is presently a wide interest in the use of hybrid
poplars for pulp and timber production.</p>
<p>There is generally no accepted control for cottonwood rust. Rust-resistant
varieties of hybrid and exotic cottonwoods are being developed
and may provide the best control of this disease.</p>

<p class="pcap">Black swellings of cherry black knot.</p>
</div>
<p>Black knot, caused by <i>Dibotryon morbosum</i>, is prevalent throughout
the Southeast (with the exception of southern Florida) wherever black
cherry grows, and in orchards on plums and domestic cherries.</p>
<p>The most prominent symptoms are the elongated black swellings which
appear in summer on small twigs and branches. Heavily infected trees
appear quite grotesque, with large swellings which may be several times
the diameter of the twigs. Cankers occurring on black cherry trunks
usually ruin the commercial tree value. Initial infection occurs on lateral
branches and twigs in the spring, but the swellings do not become
noticeable until the following spring.</p>
<p>The most practical control for black knot is removal of infected black
cherry from the stand. Twigs and branches with knots should be
burned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<h3 id="c65">NECTRIA CANKER</h3>
<p>Nectria canker of hardwoods, caused by <i>Nectria galligena</i> and <i>N. magnoliae</i>,
is frequently found on yellow birch and black walnut. Common
hosts also include bigtooth aspen, sassafras, northern red oak, red
maple, beech, Carolina poplar, paper birch, and sweet birch. A closely
related canker disease is also found on yellow-poplar and magnolias.
The range of this disease includes the Lake States, the Northeast, and
the southern Appalachians.</p>

<img src="images/i034c.jpg" alt="(cont.)" width="597" height="600" />
</div>
<p>Older Nectria cankers are easily recognized in forest stands because of
their typical &ldquo;target&rdquo; shape. &ldquo;Target&rdquo; cankers have rings, each of which
represent a year&rsquo;s growth. Younger cankers tend to be grown over by
bark and callus tissue attempting to heal the wound. Such cankers are
difficult to recognize, but close examination of the affected area may
reveal tiny red bodies, which are the fruiting bodies of the Nectria
fungi. Mortality rarely occurs from this disease, but stems may break at
canker locations during high winds.</p>
<p>Control of Nectria canker is the same as for Strumella canker&mdash;the
removal of infected trees during thinning operations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<h3 id="c66">STRUMELLA CANKER</h3>
<p>Strumella canker of hardwoods,
caused by <i>Strumella coryneoidia</i>,
most frequently attacks trees of the
red oak group. Other hosts include
species in the white oak group. Beech,
basswood, blackgum, shagbark hickory
and red maple are also occasionally
affected. This disease is found in
the East, from the southern Appalachians
to northern New England.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig105">
<img src="images/i035.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="621" />
<p class="pcap">Strumella canker on black oak.</p>
</div>
<p>Strumella cankers are of two types:
diffuse, and the more common
&ldquo;target-shaped.&rdquo; The first develops on
smooth-barked saplings and rapidly
girdles and kills the tree. Killing results
because callus tissue, which tends
to heal over cankers, does not have
time to develop. Target-shaped cankers
are more common. &ldquo;Targets&rdquo; are
formed by the alternation of killing of
bark by the fungus around the canker&rsquo;s perimeter and the formation, in
turn, of a callus ridge by the host tree. The fungus is active usually in
the dormant season, while callusing occurs in the spring. As with most
canker-causing fungi, Strumella usually enters the tree through a branch
stub. Cankers are quite large and may reach several feet in circumference
or length. The presence of the causal fungus is revealed by dark
brown, cushion-like structures about one to three millimeters in diameter
on the dead bark and surrounding tissue.</p>
<p>No feasible control method is available under forest conditions. However,
the disease impact can be greatly reduced by removing cankered
trees during thinning operations.</p>

<h3 id="c67">SPICULOSA CANKER</h3>
<p>Spiculosa canker, caused by <i>Poria spiculosa</i>, is found on bottomland
oaks in the South. Occasionally this disease will also degrade hickories
and honeylocust.</p>

<p class="pcap">Cross section of tree showing rot and decay.</p>
</div>
<p>Spiculosa canker is considered to be a canker-rot disease, a type of
decay in which the causal organism incites not only heart-rot but also
large irregular cankers. Infected trees have cankers that appear as rough
circular swellings on the bole. The canker centers are depressed and old
branch stubs are discernible. Fungus fruiting bodies, or conks, usually
are not present on living trees but develop on snags or decayed logs.
The conks grow flat under the bark and push it off to expose the brown
fungus fruiting surface.</p>
<p>Control for Spiculosa canker is similar to other canker rots: salvage to
remove undesirable cankered trees that may be later replaced by better
quality trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<h3 id="c68">IRPEX CANKER</h3>
<p>Irpex canker, caused by <i>Irpex mollis</i>, is prevalent in bottomlands and
on upland areas of the Southeast. In the bottoms, Nuttall, water, and
willow oaks are affected. White, chestnut, southern red, and black oaks
are the hosts of this disease on upland sites.</p>

</div>
<p>Irpex canker is also considered to be a canker-rot disease. Symptoms on
infected trees frequently involve irregular cankers up to two feet in
length. Cankers are usually found on trees eight to ten inches in diameter
or larger, at a height of twenty feet above the ground. Branch
stubs, signifying probable infection points, are usually present in the
centers of cankers. The portion of the trunk affected is usually swollen
but sometimes may be sunken. At the base of the sunken portion of the
canker are small, creamy-white, toothed fruiting bodies or conks with a
leathery texture. Conks also appear on hardwood logs. The wood
behind cankers is characterized by a tough, spongy, white rot which
extends as much as eight feet above and below the canker. The decay
pattern may also extend downward into the roots. In cross-section, the
rotted areas appear as finger-like projections radiating out toward the
sapwood. Gradually the rot column tapers to a thin central core beyond
which white flecks appear, and this early rot stage is concentrated along
the rays of the oaks.</p>
<p>Control for Irpex canker is the same as for other canker-rots&mdash;salvage of
undesirable cankered trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<h3 id="c69">HISPIDUS CANKER</h3>
<p><i>Polyporus hispidus</i> is the
cause of trunk cankers and
localized decay of hardwoods
throughout eastern,
central, and southern United
States. The fungus is
also known to attack hardwoods
in Oregon and California.
Reported hosts are:
hickory, ash, mulberry, willow,
walnut, and oak. In the
south, <i>P. hispidus</i> is common
on oaks, including willow,
water, black, white,
Nuttall, and cherrybark.</p>

<img src="images/i036c.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="493" />
<p class="pcap">Fruiting body and canker of Hispidus on oak.</p>
</div>
<p>The fungus usually enters
the tree through dead
branch stubs, from which it grows into the heartwood. After becoming
established, the fungus begins penetrating the sapwood and attacks the
living cambium. Callus folds are formed by the host around the dead
cambial area, forming an elongated swollen canker, commonly referred
to as a &ldquo;hispidus canker&rdquo;. The cankered area of the stem is
bark-covered and sunken, usually containing a remnant of a branch stub
or branch scar. During late summer, fall or early winter, the fungus
produces conks (sporophores) on the surface of the cankers. The annual
bracket-shaped conks are large, spongy, and yellowish-brown to
rusty-brown on the upper surface. When fresh, the under surface is a
light tan color. After a few months, the mature conks dry to a rigid
black mass and fall from the canker. Old conks are commonly found at
the base of cankered trees during the spring and early summer. Decay
produced by the fungus appears spongy, light yellow, and is commonly
separated from the sound wood by a black zone line. The rot is of the
delignifying white rot type. On southern oaks, the rate of canker
elongation has been estimated at one-half foot per year, with the
internal rot usually extending about one foot above and below the
cankered area.</p>
<p>No effective control in forest stands is known. Removal of diseased
trees provides additional growing space for crop trees. Some degree of
shade tree protection can be obtained by pruning of dead branches
flush with the main stem of the tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<h3 id="c70">BOTRYOSPHAERIA CANKER</h3>
<p><i>Botryosphaeria ribis</i> causes cankering
and mortality of more than 50 woody
plants. The fungus is widely distributed
throughout the eastern one-half of
the United States. The pathogen infects
the following economically important
hosts: sweetgum, redbud, willow,
poplar, tupelo, pecan, and
hickory.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig111">
<img src="images/i037.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="407" />
<p class="pcap">Botryosphaeria canker on sweetgum.</p>
</div>
<p>The fungus gains entry into susceptible
hosts primarily through wounds or
dead and dying twigs. Small oval
cankers on stems or branches are the
first symptoms of infection. As the
fungus continues to attack and kill the
cambium, the sunken cankers enlarge,
eventually girdling and killing the
branch or stem above the cankered
area. In the spring and early summer,
cankers on living portions of the host
often produce an exudate. Infected
sweetgums generally produce the exudate in great quantities, to which
the common name of bleeding necrosis has been applied. Reproductive
structures called stroma are produced by the fungus on dead cankered
stems and branches during moist periods of the spring and summer.</p>
<p>No practical method of control is known. Diseased trees seldom
recover. Infection of high value shade and ornamental trees may be
prevented to some degree by avoiding mechanical damage. Dead limbs
and branches should be pruned and wounds covered with a suitable tree
paint. Infected trees should be removed and burned.</p>

<p class="pcap">Septoria canker on young cottonwood saplings.</p>
</div>
<p>Septoria canker is caused by the fungus
<i>Septoria musiva</i>. Although this is a
disease of poplars, native poplar
species are not severely attacked. However,
this is an important problem
wherever hybrid or introduced poplars
are grown. With the ever-increasing
emphasis on poplar planting, this will
probably become a much more important
problem in the near future.</p>
<p>Young stem cankers usually develop
around openings such as wounds,
lenticels, or leaf scars, appearing first
as sunken, dark areas of the bark. The
infected area later becomes more depressed
and darker as tissue dies, and
often a black margin will be formed
around the canker. Small, pink, hair-like
spore tendrils are produced by the
fungus around the canker margin,
especially during moist weather. These tendrils contain spores which
can cause further infection, and arise from small dark fungal fruiting
structures called pycnidia. This cankered area is often invaded by insects
and other fungi and is also a weakened area at which wind breakage
may occur. The fungus also causes a gray to black leaf spot, which
usually has a light colored center. These spots may coalesce on a
severely infected leaf and involve the entire leaf surface. This leaf spot
in itself causes slight damage, but acts as a source of fungus spores
which can cause stem cankers, and thus is important in the overall
consideration of the disease.</p>

the amount of infection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h3 id="c72">CYTOSPORA CANKER</h3>
<p>Cytospora canker is caused by
<i>Cytospora chrysosperma</i>. This
fungus attacks more than 70
species of hardwood trees and
shrubs as well as some conifers.
Poplars and willows are among
the most common hosts, and are
attacked throughout their range.
Trees used for shade or windbreak,
and also cuttings in propagation
beds are particularly susceptible
to this canker. This
disease is most severe on trees
growing under stress, such as those growing on an unfavorable site, or
injured by drought, frost, fire, or severe pruning. The fungus is a normal
inhabitant of the bark and becomes parasitic only when the tree is
weakened.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig114">
<img src="images/i038.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="421" />
<p class="pcap">Cytospora canker on cottonwood.</p>
</div>
<p>A canker begins as a gradual, circular killing of the bark of a limb or
stem. This infected tissue soon appears as a brownish, sunken patch,
around which the host often produces raised callus tissue. Small black
fungal structures (pycnidia) appear as small pimples on the dead bark.
During moist weather, thin threads of spores exude out from the
pycnidia. The inner diseased bark becomes dark and odorous. The
cambium is killed and the sapwood becomes watery and reddish brown
as it becomes infected. Water spouts may form below the canker before
the tree dies.</p>
<p>Since this disease is most severe on weakened trees, shade trees should
be watered and fertilized to maintain healthy, vigorous growth.
Wounding and severe pruning should be avoided. Cuttings should be
selected from healthy planting material grown in disease free areas. If
cuttings are to be stored for any length of time, they should be kept at
a temperature below 35&deg;. This low temperature will keep new

<p class="pcap">Stem canker caused by chestnut blight organism.</p>
</div>
<p>Chestnut blight is caused by the
fungus <i>Endothia parasitica</i>. It
can be found on American chestnut
throughout its range where it
has virtually eliminated this valuable
species from eastern hardwood
forests. The chestnut
blight fungus is also parasitic on
other hosts including common
chinkapin, Spanish chestnut, and
post oak. Japanese and Chinese
chestnuts are resistant.</p>
<p>Stem cankers are either swollen
or sunken and the sunken type
may be grown over with bark.
The fungus forms fruiting bodies some distance back from the
advancing cankers, and the spores may exude from bark crevices as
orange curl-like masses during moist weather. Young cankers are
yellow-brown in sharp contrast to the normal olive-green color of the
bark. The chestnut is a vigorous
sprouting species but the fungus
survives in previously killed
stumps and later kills the new
sprout growth.</p>
<p>No effective control has been
developed for chestnut blight,
even after several decades of intensive
research. The most promising
control involves the development
of a blight-resistant
species. Research is presently
underway on this matter but
results are inconclusive.</p>

<h3 id="c74">OAK WILT</h3>
<p>This serious vascular wilt of oaks is caused by the fungus <i>Ceratocystis
fagacearum</i>. At least fifty species and varieties of oak are susceptible.
The disease has been most damaging in the Lake States but is also
found in the eastern United States.</p>

</div>
<div class="img" id="fig118">
<img src="images/i039a.jpg" alt="(cont.)" width="600" height="458" />
</div>
<p>Oak wilt symptoms are most noticeable during late spring or early
summer. Red oaks may be killed in as little as three weeks, the lower
branches being affected last. In white oaks, symptoms are usually
confined to a few branches each year and trees may live several years
before death. Leaf symptoms are similar for both red and white oaks.
Leaves turn yellow or brown and become dry progressively from the
edge or tip to the midrib and base. Mature leaves may fall at any
symptom stage from green to brown. Premature leaf shedding is the
most outstanding symptom. A definite characteristic of the disease is
the raising and cracking of the bark due to pressure of mats of the
fungus growing between the bark and wood.</p>
<p>Oak wilt is spread over long distances by insects that pick up spores
while crawling on the mats of infected trees. The disease may also
spread from tree to tree via root graft. Short-distance spread is
controlled by severing all roots of living trees around infected trees by
use of a ditchdigger. Another control is to fell all trees in a 50-foot
radius of infected trees; felling and burning of all parts of infected trees
is sometimes done to prevent overland spread.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig119">
<img src="images/i039b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="594" />
<p class="pcap">Dying tree infected with Dutch elm disease.</p>
</div>
<p>Dutch elm disease, caused by <i>Ceratocystis
ulmi</i>, is the most devastating
disease of elm trees in the United States.
This disease has been recorded in most
states east of the Mississippi and as far as
Idaho in the Northwest and Texas in the
Southwest. All of the native elm species
are susceptible, while many of the ornamental
Asiatic species are highly resistant.</p>
<p>Trees suffering from Dutch elm disease
may show a variety of symptoms. Leaves
become yellow, wilt, and turn brown.
Premature defoliation and death of
branches usually occurs, causing the crown to appear thin and sparse.
Internally, a brown discoloration appears in the outer sapwood. <i>C. ulmi</i>
is transmitted from diseased to healthy elms by elm bark beetles,
mainly the small European elm bark beetle and the native elm bark
beetle. These beetles make characteristic galleries under the bark of
dead and dying elms. Adult beetles pick up the sticky fungus spores
from under the bark and then feed on the young tender elm twigs of
healthy trees, inadvertently inoculating the healthy tree with the
fungus. The fungus may also spread from diseased elms to adjacent
healthy elms through root grafts.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig120">
<img src="images/i039c.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="580" />
<p class="pcap">Discoloration and streaking symptoms in the sapwood.</p>
</div>
<p>Controls to combat this disease
generally involve sanitary measures
aimed at the beetles. Dead
and dying elms should be burned.
This eliminates the elm wood
which normally serves as a breeding
place for elm bark beetles
and thus reduces the beetle population.
In areas where most native
elms are infected, other tree
species or resistant elm species,
such as the Chinese or Siberian
elm, should be planted rather
them native elms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h3 id="c76">ELM PHLOEM NECROSIS</h3>
<p>Elm phloem necrosis is a disease of
elm, caused by a virus or virus-like
organism. The disease has occurred in
the United States for many years,
probably as early as 1882. The pathogen
is transmitted from infected to
healthy trees by the adult white-banded
elm leafhopper, <i>Scaphoideus
luteolus</i>, which feeds on the leaf veins.
It is now present throughout most of
the central, eastern, and southern portions
of the United States. The disease
is known to occur on American and
winged elm, but all native elms are
probably susceptible to attack by the
pathogen.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig121">
<img src="images/i040.jpg" alt="" width="502" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Foliage symptoms of elm phloem necrosis.</p>
</div>
<p>The earliest symptoms of the disease appear in the top of the crown, at
the outer tips of the branches. Here the elm leaves suddenly wilt, turn
yellow, the margins curl upward and the
leaves die. Leaf-fall causes the crown to
appear sparse. In large trees, the foliage
symptoms may initially appear on one
branch or only a portion of the crown.
However, the symptoms during the advanced
stage of the disease are exhibited
throughout the crown. The most reliable
symptom appears as a yellow to butterscotch
discoloration on the inner bark
surface or phloem. This symptom
initially appears under the bark of large
roots, later spreading to the base of the
main stem and finally to the larger
branches. Phloem and cambial discoloration
is often found in advance of the
foliage symptoms. The moderately discolored
phlomen has a slight odor of
wintergreen. Thus far, all trees known to
be infected with the pathogen have died.
Acutely infected trees, while initially appearing healthy, may wilt and
die in three to four weeks.</p>

<p>No effective controls are known. The &ldquo;Christine Buisman&rdquo; elm, which
is highly resistant to Dutch elm disease, has demonstrated resistance to
elm phloem necrosis.</p>

<h3 id="c77">MIMOSA WILT</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig123">
<img src="images/i040b.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="657" />
<p class="pcap">Mimosa branches showing wilt symptoms.</p>
</div>
<p>A vascular wilt of the mimosa (silktree) is
caused by the fungus <i>Fusarium oxysporum
forma perniciosum</i>. The fungus is known
only to attack the mimosa, a tree imported
from eastern Asia and grown throughout
the southeast as an ornamental. Since the
discovery of the disease in North Carolina
in 1935, the fungus has spread north to
Maryland, south to Florida, and west to
Texas.</p>
<p>The fungus causing mimosa wilt is soil-borne
and gains entrance into the tree by
attacking the roots. Once entrance is gained
by the fungus, the pathogen enters the
outer water-conductive system in the sapwood.
As the fungus grows throughout
the system, it hinders or completely inhibits
the water movement from the roots to
the aerial portion of the tree. The first
outward symptom of disease is the wilting of leaflets, usually in
the upper portion of the crown. The wilted leaflets turn yellow, then
brown, and die. Often a branch or two will succumb at a time until the
entire crown is dead. A second symptom of
the disease is found in the outer sapwood of
the tree. A brown discoloration, appearing as
spots or a ring, is observed by cutting into the
outer sapwood of the infected stem or
branch.</p>
<p>Control of the fungus is very difficult, since it
is soil-borne and enters through the roots.
However, resistant varieties of mimosa trees,
developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
are now available at most commercial
nurseries.</p>

<h3 id="c78">VERTICILLIUM WILT</h3>
<p>Verticillium wilt, caused by common
soil-inhabiting fungi belonging to the
genus <i>Verticillium</i>, is found on a number
of hardwood hosts. In southern
and eastern United States elms and
maples are attacked throughout their
natural ranges.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig125">
<img src="images/i041.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="635" />
<p class="pcap">Wilting foliage and defoliation of elms caused by Verticillium wilt.</p>
</div>
<p>Infected trees may die within a few
weeks after the first symptoms are observed,
or they may survive for years.
The first symptoms of the disease involve
a wilting of the foliage, with the
leaves turning yellow and finally
brown. The early symptoms are often
restricted to a single limb or portion
of the crown. Vascular discoloration,
which is brown in elms and green in maples, is present in the outer
sapwood. In elms, this discoloration is similar to that produced in trees
having Dutch elm disease.</p>
<p>This disease is not of serious consequence in forest stands. However, it
is often extremely important in high value shade trees. Dead or dying
limbs on lawn trees may be pruned out. This may not always save the
tree, but may help keep it alive for years. Trees should be well watered
and fertilized as necessary. If a lawn tree dies from Verticillium wilt, it
should be replaced by a resistant species.</p>

<h3 id="c79">ARMILLARIA ROOT AND BUTT ROT</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig126">
<img src="images/i041a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="465" />
<p class="pcap">Mushroom or fruiting bodies of the &ldquo;honey mushroom&rdquo; rot.</p>
</div>
<p>Armillaria root and butt rot is
caused by the fungus <i>Armillaria
mellea</i>. This disease is common
in orchards, vineyards, gardens,
parks, and forests throughout the
world. Both coniferous and hardwood
forest trees are attacked.
The fungus is especially troublesome
in plantations, particularly
in stands recently thinned.</p>
<p>The fungus is spread by spores
produced by honey-colored
mushrooms, rhizomorphs, and
root contacts between diseased
trees or stumps and healthy trees. Rhizomorphs are visible strands of
compacted mycelium (fungus material) that appear as black or reddish-brown
&ldquo;shoestrings.&rdquo; They may be flattened when found between bark
and wood or cylindrical when found in decayed wood or soil. Rhizomorphs
increase in length at their tips and in this manner the fungus
may move through the soil from infected trees to uninfected trees. The
honey-colored mushrooms are produced annually and are fairly short
lived; they are subject to desiccation, and are favored by small mammals.
The size of the top varies from two to five inches in diameter. The
top is usually flecked with dark brown scales. White to light yellow gills
are borne underneath. Crown symptoms of the trees affected are similar
to those caused by any malfunctioning of the roots. A reduction in size
and production of leaves or needles, a general thinning of the crown,
branch dying, and yellowing of foliage may precede death or trees may
die rapidly with a rapid red discoloration
of the foliage. Trees
often die in groups, but single-tree
kill is also common. Cankers
bleeding resin, gum or other exudate
at the tree base are common
symptoms.</p>
<p>Control is not attempted for this
disease under forest conditions.
Losses may be reduced by following
proper planting procedures,
and by salvage cutting.</p>

<h3 id="c80">CYLINDROCLADIUM ROOT ROT</h3>
<p>This nursery disease is caused by
two fungi species. <i>Cylindrocladium
scoparium</i> and <i>C. floridanum</i>: Cylindrocladium
root rot has been found
on two hardwoods (yellow-poplar
and black walnut) and two conifers
(white pine and Fraser fir) in forest
tree nurseries in six southern states.
These include Virginia, West Virginia,
North Carolina, Tennessee,
Alabama, and Mississippi.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig128">
<img src="images/i042.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="542" />
<p class="pcap">Leaf symptoms on 1-0 black walnut nursery stock.</p>
</div>
<p>Root rot symptoms on hardwoods
and conifers are quite different.
The most characteristic root
symptoms on yellow-poplar and
black walnut are the blackened and longitudinally-cracked infected
roots that are in sharp contrast with healthy white roots of these two
species. Infected seedling leaves become yellow and later turn reddish-brown.</p>
<p>Root rot symptoms on conifers involve either rotting of the seed or
seedling (pre-emergence damping off) before emergence from the soil or
seedling root rot following emergence. These symptoms also involve a
shrivelling and reddening of foliage, needle blight, and stem cankers.
The most characteristic symptoms are the &ldquo;patchy&rdquo; irregularly scattered
pattern of infection in conifer seedling beds and the loosening of the
root epidermis on infected roots&mdash;making it very easy to pull off.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig129">
<img src="images/i042a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="397" />
<p class="pcap">Root symptoms on 1-0 yellow-poplar nursery stock.</p>
</div>
<p>The most practical and effective
control for root rot diseases of
this type involves strict quarantine
to either keep the disease
out of the nursery or keep it
confined to known infected areas
by avoiding the transportation of
root material, organic matter,
and soil from infected to non-infected
seed beds. Soil fumigation
may control this disease if
applied under favorable conditions.</p>

<img src="images/i042b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="418" />
<p class="pcap">Fruiting body of Lucidus root and butt rot on mimosa.</p>
</div>
<p><i>Polyporus lucidus</i> is the
cause of root and basal
stem decay of hardwood
trees throughout the eastern,
central, and southern
portions of the United
States. The fungus is
known to attack and kill
maple, hackberry,
orange, lemon, ash,
sweetgum, oak, locust,
elm, tupelo, willow, and
mimosa. Mimosa trees are
very susceptible to attack
by <i>P. lucidus</i> throughout
the South.</p>
<p>The disease is characterized by a rapid decline and death of the host.
Examination of infected roots will reveal a soft spongy white rot with
black spots scattered throughout. Fruiting bodies are formed at the
base of infected trees or on the surface of exposed roots. The mature
fruiting bodies are a reddish brown above and white below, with the
tops and stems appearing glazed or varnished. The fungus is believed to
gain entrance into the host through bark and root injuries and can
spread from infected to healthy trees through root contacts and grafts.</p>
<p>No control is known for this disease. Avoidance of lawnmower and
other mechanical injuries to the base of roots of susceptible shade trees
will reduce the chance of infection by the fungus. The spread of the
disease from infected to healthy trees can be reduced by planting at a
wide enough spacing to avoid root contacts and grafts.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
